<h2><!-- page v--><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>
<p>This little group of Rugby Sermons is to be taken and read as being
nothing more than a few stray chips from the workshop of a busy schoolmaster,
brought together by a kindly publisher, and arranged as he thought best.</p>
<p>They represent no body of continuous doctrine.&nbsp; In one case
the subject may have been suggested by the season of the Christian year;
in another it was the meeting or the parting at the beginning or the
end of a term that suggested it; or more frequently some incident in
the school life of the moment.</p>
<p>Such, indeed, almost inevitably is the teaching of a schoolmaster,
engrossed in the training of the boys committed to his charge and growing
under his hand towards the destiny of their endless life.</p>
<p>To those boys, and to the masters, my <!-- page vi--><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>colleagues,
and to other fellow-labourers&mdash;some gone to their rest, some still
doing their appointed work&mdash;I dedicate this brief reminder of our
common life in days of happy fellowship.</p>
<p>J. HEREFORD.<br />

<h2><!-- page 1--><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I.&nbsp; RELIGIOUS
PATRIOTISM.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Jerusalem is built as a city that is at unity
in itself. . . . O pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper
that love thee.&nbsp; Peace be within thy walls, and plenteousness within
thy palaces.&nbsp; For my brethren and companions&rsquo; sakes I will
wish thee prosperity.&nbsp; Yea, because of the house of the Lord our
God I will seek to do thee good.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Psalm
</span>cxxii. 3, 6-9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we draw near to the end of our summer term, when so many are about
to take leave of their school life, there is sure to rise up in many
minds the thought of what this life has done for them or failed to do,
and of what the memory of it is likely to be in all their future years
as they pass from youth to age.</p>
<p>And it should be our aim and desire, as need hardly be said, that
from the day when each one comes amongst us as a little boy to <!-- page 2--><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>the
day when he offers his last prayer in this chapel before he goes out
into the world, his life here should be of such a sort that its after
taste may have no regrets, and no bitterness, and no shame in it, and
the memories to be cherished may be such as add to the happiness and
strength of later years.&nbsp; And if, as we trust, this is your case,
your feeling for your school is almost certain to be in some degree
like that which is expressed in this pilgrim psalm.&nbsp; Its language
of intense patriotism, steeped in religious feeling, which is the peculiar
inspiration of the Old Testament Jew, will seem somehow to express your
own feelings for that life in which you grew up from childhood to manhood.</p>
<p>Indeed, the best evidence that your school life has not failed of
its higher objects is the growth of this same sort of earnest patriotic
enthusiasm.&nbsp; Do you feel at all for your school as that unknown
Jewish pilgrim who first sung this 122nd Psalm felt for the city of
his fathers and the house of God?&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray for the peace of
Jerusalem: <!-- page 3--><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>they shall
prosper that love thee.&nbsp; For my brethren and companions&rsquo;
sakes I will wish thee prosperity.&nbsp; Yea, because of the house of
the Lord our God I will seek to do thee good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Experience shows us that those English schools have been the best
in which this feeling has been strongest and most widely diffused; and
that those are the best times in any school which train up and send
forth the largest proportion of men who continue to watch over its life,
and to pray for it in this spirit: &ldquo;For my brethren and companions&rsquo;
sakes I will wish thee prosperity.&nbsp; Yea, because of the house of
the Lord our God I will seek to do thee good.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other
hand, if this feeling is weak in any school, or among the former members
of it, or if it assumes debased forms, as sometimes happens, we see
there a sure sign of degeneration.&nbsp; He who, having grown up in
any society like ours, is possessed by no such love for it, and stirred
by no enthusiasm for its good name, and no desire to do it good, and
to see good growing <!-- page 4--><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>in
every part of it, such an one has somehow missed the chief blessing
that his membership of his school should have brought to him.&nbsp;
He may have been unfortunate, or he may have proved unworthy.&nbsp;
The atmosphere of his school life, and the associations amidst which
he grew up, may have been such that the best thing he can do is to shake
himself clear of them and forget them.&nbsp; To such an one his school
time has been a grave and lifelong misfortune; and it is the condemnation
of any society if there are many such cases in it.</p>
<p>It is, however, exceptional in English life for men who have grown
up in a great school to be stirred by no glow of patriotic feeling for
it.&nbsp; Whatever their own experience of it may have been, they are
not altogether blind to the things that constitute its greatness, and
they love to hear it well spoken of.</p>
<p>But the quality of their patriotism will depend very much on the
quality of their own life; so that the task we have always before us
is to be infusing into our community such a spirit and purpose, as shall
infect each soul <!-- page 5--><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>amongst
us with those higher aims, and tastes, and motives, with that hatred
of things mean or impure, and that love of things that are manly, honest,
and of good report, which distinguish all nobler characters from the
baser, and which are produced and fostered, and made to work strongly
in every society that has any claim to good influence.</p>
<p>Seeing, then, that a man&rsquo;s patriotism is to a great extent
the expression of his personal life, how instructive is this picture
of the patriot which the 122nd Psalm sets before us.&nbsp; We see thus
first of all how he feels the unity of his people&mdash;their one pervading
life, and himself a part of it, though possibly far away&mdash;&ldquo;Jerusalem
is built as a city that is at unity in itself: thither the tribes go
up.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those were times when Israel suffered from division
of tribe against tribe, times when the pulse of common life hardly beat
at all, times of isolation or of jealousy; but the true patriot in Israel,
as everywhere, was always possessed by the intense feeling of the oneness
of his people under one Lord; and whenever this <!-- page 6--><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>feeling
fails, we look in vain for the higher forms of common life.</p>
<p>But we note, too, this Psalmist&rsquo;s passionate personal devotion
to the object of his patriotic love&mdash;&ldquo;They shall prosper
that love thee&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;For my brethren and companions&rsquo;
sakes I will wish thee prosperity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Who can read unmoved
these noble and generous outpourings?</p>
<p>We see, moreover, how his feeling expresses itself, as true love
always does express itself in the desire to do good to its object, and,
above all, how it breathes the spirit of moral and religious earnestness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God I will seek to
do thee good.&rdquo;&nbsp; If ever you desire to test the sincerity
and the worth of any love you bear to person, place, institution, or
society, you have only to turn to this Psalm, and see if these words
fit your thoughts, desires, and endeavours&mdash;&ldquo;They shall prosper
that love thee&mdash;For my brethren and companions&rsquo; sakes I will
wish thee prosperity&mdash;Yea, because of the house of the Lord our
God I will seek <!-- page 7--><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>to do
thee good.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here are the notes of true patriotic feeling&mdash;personal
love, public spirit, sanctified by moral and religious purpose, desire
to do good.&nbsp; These are the qualities which are the salt of all
societies, and it is by virtue of these that they win their good name,
if they do win it.</p>
<p>In the history of our own school we can point to abundant illustrations
of this truth.&nbsp; I will mention one only, familiar to those who
know our history.&nbsp; &ldquo;I verily believe,&rdquo; wrote a School-house
boy to his friend fifty-three years ago&mdash;&ldquo;I verily believe
my whole being is soaked through with wishing and hoping and striving
to do the school good, or, rather, to hinder it from falling in this
critical time, so that all my cares, and affections, and conversation,
thought, words, and deeds, look to that involuntarily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was one of your predecessors as he sat here Sunday by Sunday,
a boy like any of you.</p>
<p>He was eager to follow those friends who had preceded him to Oxford
as scholars of <!-- page 8--><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Balliol;
he was keenly interested in all intellectual pursuits; he turned for
his daily pleasure to literature or history; but alongside of it all,
or rather through it all, underlying it all, giving earnestness and
fervour, the true unselfish quality, to it all, there was burning in
his heart a consuming zeal for the good of his house and school.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For my brethren and companions&rsquo; sakes I will wish thee
prosperity.&nbsp; Yea, because of the house of the Lord our God I will
seek to do thee good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was through the spirit and the lives of such as he, growing up
here, and leavening all the life around them, and then going forth in
the same spirit, to live the noble and earnest type of life elsewhere,
that the name of Rugby School became honoured among schools, and this
chapel came to be looked upon as a sacred home of inspiring influences;
and it is only through an unfailing succession of such Rugbeians&mdash;growing
up here in the same spirit, and going forth endowed with the same character
and the same purpose&mdash;<!-- page 9--><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>
that this honourable name, this tradition of good influences, can be
perpetuated.</p>
<p>And, if we desire to see how close this is to the spirit and the
work of our Lord, how it is, in fact, one manifestation of that spirit
which is the saving influence in human life; we have only to turn from
the text with which I started to that with which I may conclude, from
the Psalmist meditating on the city and temple of his heart&rsquo;s
affections, to the Saviour, as He drew near to the Cross, praying for
His disciples&mdash;&ldquo;Father, the hour is come. . . . I have glorified
Thee on the earth: I have finished the work Thou gavest Me to do.&nbsp;
I have manifested Thy name unto the men whom Thou gavest me out of the
world.&rdquo; . . . &ldquo;And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, that
they also may be sanctified.&nbsp; Neither pray I for these alone, but
for them also which shall believe on Me through their word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The only change we see as we step from the Psalms to the Gospel,
from the Jewish pilgrim to the Saviour whom we worship, is that religious
patriotism has expanded into the <!-- page 10--><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>love
of souls, the love of Him who laid down His life to save us from the
power of sin and death.</p>
<p>It was for you and me that Christ was praying; and His prayer for
us will be answered so soon as it inspires us to follow in His footsteps,
so that we too, as we kneel before God each morning, each night, and
think of our duty to those around us, may be able to say, in these words
of His, which are at once a prayer and a consecrating vow&mdash;&ldquo;For
their sakes I sanctify myself, that they also may be sanctified.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 11--><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>II.&nbsp; THE CHILD
IN THE MIDST.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And He took a child and set Him in the midst of
them: and when He had taken him in His arms, He said unto them, Whosoever
shall receive one of such children in My name, receiveth Me: and whosoever
shall receive Me, receiveth not Me, but Him that sent Me.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St.
Mark </span>ix. 36, 37.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is one of the characteristics of our time, one of its most hopeful
and most encouraging signs, that men are awaking to higher and purer
conceptions of the Christian life and what it is that constitutes such
a life.&nbsp; We are beginning to feel, as it was not felt by former
generations, that the only true religion, the only Christianity worthy
of the name, is that which aims at embodying and reproducing the spirit,
the thought, the ideas of the Saviour.</p>
<p>Through and underneath all ecclesiastical and medi&aelig;val revivals,
and all vagaries of <!-- page 12--><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>church
tradition or of ritual, this feeling seems to be growing with a steady
growth, that the real test of a man&rsquo;s religion is the evidence
which his life affords of the Christ-like spirit.&nbsp; And this growing
feeling gives an ever-fresh interest to the words and the judgment of
the Lord on all matters of individual conduct and daily intercourse;
so that if we are possessed at all by it, the Saviour is becoming more
of a living person to us, and we ask ourselves more frequently, more
earnestly, with more of reality and more of practical meaning in the
question, how He would judge this or that side of our life, whether
our conduct is in harmony with His spirit, and whether the standards
of our life fit at all with His teaching and injunctions.</p>
<p>And how full of new meaning every familiar chapter of the Gospel
becomes to you, if you are once roused to this kind of feeling; if you
are feeling all the time, here is the spirit which should be dominating
my own life and determining it, here are the thoughts, <!-- page 13--><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>ideas,
and views of conduct which should be mine also.&nbsp; How does my common
life fit with all this?&nbsp; And it is with something like this feeling
in your minds that I would ask you to consider the text I have just
read to you.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jesus took a child and set him in the midst
of them.&nbsp; He took him up in His arms and said, Whosoever shall
receive one of such children in My name, receiveth Me.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And while we are considering it, let us notice also that in St. Matthew&rsquo;s
narrative there are two other very emphatic expressions.&nbsp; &ldquo;Except
ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into
the Kingdom of Heaven&rdquo;; and &ldquo;Whoso shall offend one of these
little ones that believe in Me, it were better for him that a millstone
were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth of the
sea. . . . Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for
I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face
of My Father which is in heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, then, is the child taken up by Jesus and set in the midst;
we know nothing more <!-- page 14--><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of
him but this one thing, that he represents to us our Lord&rsquo;s Divine
love of little children, and His high estimate of childhood, as the
mysterious embodiment of that character and those qualities which bring
us close to the Divine life.</p>
<p>But this is quite enough to make us listen to the lessons of thought
and warning and hope, which Jesus expounds to us as He stands with the
child in His arms.&nbsp; His words may very well set every one of us
thinking about our own life and conduct.&nbsp; We look at this scene&mdash;the
disciples standing round, their hearts occupied, as ours are apt to
be, with their own ambitions, rivalries, and jealousies, and Jesus in
the midst with the little child; and we cannot mistake or misinterpret
the lessons He teaches us, the lessons which welled up in His heart
whenever He saw, or met, or took up in His arms, and blessed a little
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let every child you meet,&rdquo; he clearly says to us, &ldquo;remind
you that if you desire to be My disciple and to win a place in My kingdom,
you <!-- page 15--><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>must fling off
selfishness, and put in its place the spirit of service and tenderness.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;He that would be first must be servant of all.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You
must humble yourself as this little child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then He adds the blessing and the warning:&mdash;&ldquo;Whoso
shall receive one such child in My name receiveth Me; but whosoever
shall offend one of these little ones, it were better for him that a
millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We may pause for a moment to consider what it is in childhood, what
are the gifts, qualities, characteristics of the child, that drew from
our Lord this special love and care and these injunctions to His followers.&nbsp;
We do well to bear them in mind, because He has declared with such emphasis
that we have no part in His kingdom unless we retain or recover these
gifts.&nbsp; And we should bear them in mind, because of the blessing
promised to those who help to preserve these qualities in others.&nbsp;
Receive, help, cherish, or protect a child, make the way of goodness
<!-- page 16--><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>easy to him, and shield
him from evil, and Christ declares that inasmuch as you have done it
to the least of all His little ones, you have done it unto Him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, offend any such child, that is to say, hinder,
or mislead, spoil or degrade him in any way; do anything to rob a child
of any of these Divine gifts, rob him of his innocence, or trustfulness,
or his guileless heart, and sow the seeds of evil habits or tastes in
their place, and you know the denunciation or curse which the Divine
voice has laid upon you for your evil deed.</p>
<p>A child, then, is, as it were, a living symbol of that which draws
to us the love of Christ, and we cannot doubt that he is so by virtue
of his innocence, his obedient spirit, his guilelessness, or simplicity
of character, his trustfulness, and by all the untarnished and unspoilt
possibilities of goodness in him.</p>
<p>It is in the blessed endowment of such gifts as these that the little
child looks in the face of Christ, and is embraced in the arms of His
love.</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>And these are, or
they once were, your gifts.&nbsp; As you love the better life, and hope
for good days, hold them fast and cherish them, or if any of them be
unhappily lost, let it be your endeavour to recover it.</p>
<p>As we contemplate such a scene as this in our Lord&rsquo;s life with
the little child in the midst, and listen to the Saviour&rsquo;s words,
all the commands and injunctions to keep innocency, to keep the spirit
of obedience, to keep a guileless and trusting and loving heart, gain
a new force.&nbsp; They seem to speak to us with new voices; for if
the true life, the life that has in it the hope of union with Christ,
must be a life endowed with these gifts, whether in youth or age, what
a blessed thing it will be for you if you have never lost or squandered
them.&nbsp; We cannot too soon learn this lesson; for if under the influence
of any wrong motives, or following any wrong ideals, or misled by any
bad example, you go astray and rob your young life of these divine gifts,
no man knows how, or when, <!-- page 18--><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>or
where you will recover them, and become again as a little child.</p>
<p>And if we turn our thoughts from our own separate personal life,
and look for a moment at our duty as members of a society, how this
picture of Christ embracing the little child, and blessing those who
receive or help one such, should stir us to new and keener interest
in social duty!&nbsp; Does it not carry in it, this example and teaching
of the Lord, does it not carry in it the condemnation of a great many
of our traditional notions about our duty to the young?&nbsp; We see
the Lord&rsquo;s tenderness and love and care for the little child;
we see how He values the childlike qualities; and how He enjoins the
nursing and the cherishing of these.&nbsp; If, then, we have really
learnt the lesson which He thus presses upon us, we shall feel something
like reverence for every young life, as it begins its perilous and uncertain
course on the sea of man&rsquo;s experiences; and with this feeling
we shall be eager to help and protect such lives whenever we have the
<!-- page 19--><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>chance of doing it,
and we shall be very careful to do them no wrong.</p>
<p>But when we turn from the Gospel and these thoughts which it stirs
in us to our common life of every day, does it not rather seem sometimes
as if this teaching of the Lord were all a dream and had no reality?&nbsp;
And yet there is hardly one of us but would confess that, having once
seen this revelation of the Lord, we are put to shame if, as happens
sometimes, a young soul comes amongst us endowed with these very gifts
of innocence, and high purpose, and trust, and promise of all goodness,
which so won the Saviour&rsquo;s heart, and is met, when he comes, in
school or house, not by care, or sympathy, or guidance, or protection,
as of an elder brother&rsquo;s love, but by experiences of a very different
sort.&nbsp; You would agree that it is a shame to us if such an one
comes only to find the misleading influence of some thoughtless or bad
companion, or to have held up before him some bad tradition as the law
which should rule his life here.</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>I have known&mdash;which
of us in the course of years has not known?&mdash;such cases in our
school experience.&nbsp; A child has come from a refined and loving
home, but only to meet with roughness or coarseness; and instead of
retaining those gifts and qualities of childhood, which are the godlike
qualities of life and meant to be permanent, he has been led to grow
up utterly unchildlike, depraved, debased, hardened; and there is no
sadder sight to see than a growth of this kind.&nbsp; And if you have
ever seen it; if you have ever noticed the falling away from childlike
innocence to sin, from purity to coarseness, from the open, ingenuous,
trusting spirit to sullen hardness, from happiness to gloom, you know
how terribly in earnest the Saviour must have been when He denounced
that woe on any one who causes such debasement of a young soul&mdash;&ldquo;Whoso
shall offend one of these little ones, it had been better for him that
a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were drowned in the depth
of the sea.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 21--><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>III.&nbsp; THE
BREVITY OF LIFE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I must work the works of Him that sent Me, while
it is day: the night cometh.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. John
</span>ix. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are few things more commonly disregarded by us in our early
years than the brevity of our life through all its successive stages,
and the fleeting nature of its opportunities.</p>
<p>In childhood we are almost entirely unconscious of both these characteristics
of life.&nbsp; Indeed, it would hardly be natural if it were otherwise.&nbsp;
That reflective habit which dwells upon them is the result of our experience,
and comes later.&nbsp; It is enough for a child if he follows pure and
safe instincts, and lives without reflection a healthy, unperverted
life, under wise guidance and good teaching.&nbsp; Growing in this way,
free from corrupting <!-- page 22--><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>influences
or the contagion of bad example, and poisoned by no bad atmosphere,
he develops naturally towards a manhood which is rooted in healthy tastes,
affections unspoilt, and in good habits.&nbsp; Thus you see what the
very young have a right to claim at the hands of all their elders&mdash;that
they should be careful not to mislead them, and should see that they
live in pure air, and feed their growing instincts and activities in
wholesome pastures.</p>
<p>During the stage of earliest growth it would be a sign of unhealthy
precocity if a child were much occupied with the continuity of things,
or the close union of to-day with to-morrow, or of all our thoughts,
acts, pleasures, and tastes, with the bent of character which is being
silently but surely formed in us; and it would be equally unnatural
if his thoughts were to dwell much on the essential shortness of our
life, and the flight of opportunity which does not come back to us.</p>
<p>It is part of the happiness, or, I fear, it must be said sometimes,
part of the pain <!-- page 23--><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>of
early life, that the time before it seems so long.&nbsp; The day is
long with its crowded novelty or intense enjoyment, or possibly with
its dreary and intolerable task-work; to-morrow, with all its anticipations
of things desired or to be endured, seems long; and the vista of years,
as they stretch through boyhood and youth, manhood and age, seems to
lose itself in the far distance of its length.&nbsp; So, viewed from
its beginnings, life is long.</p>
<p>But with the approach of manhood all this begins to change.&nbsp;
As we grow out of childhood our self-conscious and reflective life grows;
and thus there rises in us the feeling of moral responsibility never
to be shaken off again.&nbsp; Not, however, that we should leave all
our childhood behind us.&nbsp; It hardly needs to be said that there
are some characteristics of our earliest years which every man should
pray that he may retain to the end.&nbsp; Unless he retains them his
life becomes a deteriorating life.</p>
<p>And first among these is the reverential <!-- page 24--><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>or
filial habit.&nbsp; This deserves our careful attention, because we
sometimes see an affectation of silly and spurious manliness, which
thinks it a fine thing to cast it off.&nbsp; This reverential or filial
feeling, which is natural to the unspoilt and truthful nature of the
child, is preserved in every unspoilt manhood; only with a difference.</p>
<p>It is raised from the unreflective, instinctive trust in a father&rsquo;s
guidance or a mother&rsquo;s love to that higher feeling which tells
us that, as is the child in a well and wisely ordered home, so is each
of us in that great household of our heavenly Father.&nbsp; This spirit
of true piety, which uplifts, refines, strengthens, and gives courage
to manhood, as nothing else can do, is the natural outcome and successor
of a child&rsquo;s trustfulness, as we rise through it to the feeling
that we are encompassed by a Divine consciousness, and that our life
moves in a holy presence.&nbsp; Or again, we pray that we may not lose
that simplicity and freshness of nature which is at once a special charm
of childhood, and, <!-- page 25--><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>wherever
it is preserved, the chief blessing of a man&rsquo;s later years.</p>
<p>These qualities and characteristics of our infancy&mdash;trust, filial
reverence, freshness, simplicity&mdash;are not qualities to be left
behind, but the natural forecast of that religious spirit which is the
highest growth of maturity, and our own safeguard against the hardening
and debasing influences of the world and the flesh.&nbsp; And this was
the Saviour&rsquo;s meaning when He said, &ldquo;Whosoever shall not
receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in nowise enter therein.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And if there is one thing more than another that constitutes the special
curse of any depraved influence acting on young lives, it is that it
robs the later life of these childlike qualities which are the gifts
of God to bless us in youth and age.</p>
<p>But assuming that we bear all this in mind, and hold fast to these
fundamental gifts, and so escape those lower and baser forms of life
which we meet all about in the world, spoiling the manhood and embittering
<!-- page 26--><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>the age of so many
men, we cannot forget the essential difference between mature years
and the years of early growth.</p>
<p>As we grow towards manhood our life necessarily loses its childlike
and unreflecting spontaneity in the ferment of thought, desire, and
passion, and in the light of experience; and therefore it becomes a
matter of no slight importance to estimate the value of that which we
hold in our hands to-day, the nature of the web which our conduct is
weaving, and the fateful character of any mistake in the purposes, notions,
ambitions, or tastes that are, as a matter of fact, fixing the drift
and direction of our life.&nbsp; But to do this amidst all the daily
temptations of life is not always an easy matter; and it is certain
that we shall not do it if we do not fully recognise, while our life
is still young and unhampered, the importance of these two very obvious
reflections, which, in fact, resolve themselves into one, that our time
is essentially short, and that our opportunities are very fugitive.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>In one sense, no
doubt, there is a long stretch of time before most of you.&nbsp; As
yet hope has more to say to you than memory.&nbsp; Some of you will
look back on these early days from the distant years of another century.&nbsp;
Your life&rsquo;s journey may extend far away over the unexplored future,
and may in some cases be a very long one; but, although this is possible,
we are not allowed to forget that it is always precarious&mdash;unexpected
graves are constantly reminding us how short may be the time of any
one of us&mdash;how the night cometh.</p>
<p>But it is not merely of the literal shortness of our time, or the
possible nearness of death, that our Lord&rsquo;s words should set us
thinking, when He warns us that the night cometh, and we must work while
it is day.</p>
<p>If we measure our life by the things we should accomplish in it,
by the character it should attain to, by the purposes that should be
bearing fruit in it, and not by mere lapse of time, we soon come to
feel how <!-- page 28--><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>very short
it is, and the sense of present duty grows imperative.&nbsp; It is thus
that the thoughtful man looks at his life; and he feels that there is
no such thing as length of days which he can without blame live carelessly,
because in these careless days critical opportunities will have slipped
away irrecoverably; he will have drifted in his carelessness past some
turning-point which he will not see again, and have missed the so-called
chances that come no more.</p>
<p>But even this is only a part of the considerations that make our
present life so precious; for this is only the outer aspect of it.&nbsp;
What makes our time so critically short, whether we consider its intellectual
or its moral and spiritual uses, is that our nature is so very sensitive,
so easily marred by misuse, and spoilt irretrievably.&nbsp; The real
brevity of the time at your disposal, whether for the training of your
mind, or for your growth into the character of good men, consists in
this, that deterioration is standing always at the back of any neglect
or waste.&nbsp; <!-- page 29--><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Deterioration
is the inseparable shadow of every form of ignoble life.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our acts our angels are, for good or ill,<br />
Our fatal shadows that walk with us still.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Leave your faculties unused and they become blunted and dulled; leave
your higher tastes uncultivated and they die; let your affections feed
on anything unworthy and they become debased.</p>
<p>To those who do this it may happen that whilst, so far as years go,
they are still in all the freshness of youth, they are already dying
that death to all higher capacity which is worse than any decay of our
physical organism.&nbsp; Such an early death of higher tastes and faculties,
and of hope for the future, is sometimes effected even before schooldays
are over.&nbsp; And the mere possibility of such a fate overhanging
any of us should stir us like a trumpet-call to take care that we do
not surrender our life to any mean influence, and that we are very <!-- page 30--><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>zealous
for all that concerns the safety of the young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I send out my child,&rdquo; I can imagine the parent of any
one of you having said, &ldquo;to be trained for manhood; I send him
to his school that his intellect may be cultivated, his moral purpose
made strong, and that all good and pure tastes may be fostered in him;
but it is dreadful to think that instead of this he may, by his life
and companionship there, be hardened and debased, or even brutalised;
he may become dead to the higher life even before he becomes a man.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Seeing, then, that there is this possibility of death even in the midst
of life&mdash;a possibility, we would fain hope, seldom realised in
this school, but still a possibility&mdash;shall we not be very careful,
men and boys alike, so to do our part in this society, so to shelter
the young and strengthen the weak, and to keep the atmosphere of our
life a pure atmosphere, that every sensitive soul which comes amongst
us may <!-- page 31--><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>grow up here
through a healthy and wholesome boyhood, and go out to the duties and
the calling of his life, strong, unselfish, public-spirited, pure-hearted,
and courageous&mdash;a Christian gentleman.</p>
<h2><!-- page 32--><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>IV.&nbsp; THE INFLUENCE
OF TRADITION.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Making the word of God of none effect through
your traditions: and many such like things ye do.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St.
Mark </span>vii. 13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such was our Lord&rsquo;s word to the Pharisees; and if we turn to
our own life it is difficult if not impossible for us fully to estimate
the influence which traditions exercise upon it.</p>
<p>They are so woven into the web of thought and opinion, and daily
habits and practices, that none of us can claim to escape them.&nbsp;
Moreover, as any institution or society grows older, this influence
of the part which is handed on from one generation to another tends
to accumulate; so that the weight of it lies heavier on us in an old
place than in a new one, and it is obvious that there is both loss and
gain in this.</p>
<p>A good tradition is a great help and <!-- page 33--><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>support,
giving a strength, or firmness, or dignity to our life which it would
not otherwise have had.</p>
<p>We often see or feel the value of such a tradition as it acts upon
the members of a family, or of a college, or of a regiment, or of a
school.</p>
<p>And this influence of a tradition, inasmuch as it has become impersonal,
and rooted in the general life, is apt to be very persistent, so that
the man who establishes a good tradition anywhere begins a good work,
which may go on producing its good results long after he himself is
in his grave.</p>
<p>Many of you must have felt the power of such an influence, handed
on to you as if it were a part of your inheritance, when thinking of
a brother, or father, or other relative or ancestor, who by some distinction
of character, or by some inspiring words or some brave or generous act,
has left you a good example, which seems somehow to belong to you, and
to stir you as with an <!-- page 34--><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>authoritative
call to show yourself worthy of it.</p>
<p>Similarly in a society like this school you can hardly grow up without
sometimes being stirred by the tradition of the noble lives that have
left their mark upon its history.</p>
<p>So a man&rsquo;s good deeds live after him, and become woven as threads
of gold into the traditions of the world.</p>
<p>And we are equally familiar with traditions that are bad, and with
their pestilent influence; for we are constantly made to feel how much
of the good that men endeavour to do is thwarted, counteracted, or destroyed
by influences of this sort, and how weak and imitative souls are entangled
in the network of traditional influence as in a spider&rsquo;s web.&nbsp;
Tradition, in fact, represents to us the accumulated power of past lives
as it acts upon us from the outside, just as what men call heredity
represents this same influence in our own blood.</p>
<p>And we have seen that this power may be, and often is, a real advantage
and support <!-- page 35--><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>to our
life.&nbsp; We feel also that as the Divine light shines stronger and
steadier in human affairs the traditional influence of each generation
ought to become more and more helpful to those that follow.</p>
<p>And yet, you observe, the Saviour gives us no encouragement to depend
upon those helps that tradition might bring us.&nbsp; On the contrary,
His language shows how dangerous He felt the influence of tradition
to be.&nbsp; How are we to account for this?&nbsp; His strongest denunciations
are reserved for the Pharisaic party; and yet a historian would describe
them as in many respects the best elements of Jewish life.&nbsp; They
were earnest, patriotic, religious, many of them wise and holy men;
but their judgment was held in bondage by the influence of tradition,
and in this lies the cardinal defect of their life.&nbsp; They had set
up between their souls and the spirit of God a sort of graven image
of ritualistic observances, and traditional usages and interpretations.&nbsp;
They depended on externals, or what came to them from <!-- page 36--><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>the
past or from the outer world, and their eyes were blinded, and their
hearts hardened against every new revelation.</p>
<p>Thus they stand before Christ, blocking His path, the very embodiment
of that power which closes the soul against those inspiring and purifying
influences that come from direct communion with God.&nbsp; They block
the Saviour&rsquo;s path, because this personal communion is just what
He represents to us&mdash;the direct revelation of the Spirit of God
in man.&nbsp; He comes to reveal the Father to each of us, and to make
us feel the presence of the Divine creative Spirit in every separate
human life; and till we feel this personal illumination we have not
realised the manifestation of the Son of God.&nbsp; But the Pharisee
with his continual reference to tradition, his multiplication of external
observances, and elaborate ritual, his reliance upon usage and external
authority, knows little or nothing of the personal illumination by the
direct influence of the Spirit of God upon our spirit.&nbsp; Hence this
absolute and <!-- page 37--><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>fundamental
contrast between Jesus and the Pharisees.&nbsp; They represent two opposing
principles in life.&nbsp; And it is this that gives such intensity to
the words He addressed to them: &ldquo;Ye have made the word of God
of none effect through your traditions&rdquo;; and it is a universal
warning&mdash;never out of date.</p>
<p>If the spirit of traditional usage and influence holds the citadel
of a man&rsquo;s life, the spirit of Christian progress cannot gain
an entrance.</p>
<p>That is the lesson which the Saviour presses upon our attention by
His denunciation of the Pharisaic usage, habit, and attitude, and it
is hardly possible to overestimate the importance of the lesson, because
this same spirit of Pharisaic tradition is constantly laying its hand
upon every human institution, and it has contributed to every abuse
or perversion that has taken possession of the Christian Church.</p>
<p>Our life is, in fact, a continuous struggle between the two principles
here represented.&nbsp; Which is to prevail in it, and fix its character&mdash;<!-- page 38--><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>
traditional custom, or personal inspiration?&nbsp; Are we to follow
the world with its conventions and laws, or to live in personal communion
with God?&nbsp; The tendency of our life will be determined in one direction
or the other according as we surrender our will to the rule of traditional
notions and usages, the power of the external world, or as we seek for
direct illumination of mind, conscience, and spirit at the Divine sources
of truth and light.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have a principle to guide us in our relation to the
traditions amidst which we live.</p>
<p>We do not expect to get away from them; we never dream of escaping
from the influences of the external world, whether of the past or the
present; but to move safely among them, we must have learnt and adopted
this primal lesson, that no tradition, and no external practice or custom,
has any authoritative claim upon us, simply from being established as
a tradition or a custom.</p>
<p>And as we stand amidst all the conventions <!-- page 39--><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>and
practices that have come down to us, we should be able to say of every
one of them&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every good tradition, and every wholesome and beneficent usage,
I accept thankfully as part of the inheritance which good, or wise,
or brave men have left as their legacy for my use and assistance; but
it is my bounden duty to measure them all by the standard of God&rsquo;s
unchanging law: by it I will prove them; I will use them or reject them
according as they fit or fail in this measurement, and I will not be
brought under the power of any of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether, then, we think of our separate personal life or of our life
in its social relationships, we must think of it in this way if we are
to be in any real sense followers of Christ.&nbsp; Each of you, as he
steps into the world, is not merely an inheritor of certain accumulations
of life and tradition, which he should follow as a matter of course.&nbsp;
He is not born to tread a certain track of conduct or behaviour because
others have <!-- page 40--><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>trodden
it before him, following it without thought like the sheep on the mountain,
or like the ants as they travel from one ant-hill to another.</p>
<p>Your estimate of your life should be fundamentally different from
this.&nbsp; You are primarily a child of God, illumined by direct communion
with the Spirit of God; and your first duty, therefore, whenever and
in whatever place or circumstances you may chance to be, is not to follow
this or that tradition or usage which may meet you; but to stand up
and show that you are God&rsquo;s child, and therefore a judge of all
traditions or customs, and not their slave.</p>
<p>This is the revelation which Christ declares to us as the one first
requisite of the Christian life.&nbsp; So you see the Christian man&rsquo;s
attitude towards all traditions or customs is that of independence;
his thought and his judgment are as free in regard to them as if they
were newly born.&nbsp; He is, in fact, bound to judge them according
to their deserts; and no society can hope to prosper <!-- page 41--><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>unless
this is recognised, so that evil customs may not corrupt the common
life.&nbsp; It is the danger of such corruption that makes the Saviour
denounce the traditional habit, and summon His followers to live by
the rule of close personal communion with God.&nbsp; Thus the life that
goes forward and rises to higher and yet higher levels is always a life
of new revelations, a life which is being illumined and illumined afresh
by those flashes of Divine insight, and strength, and courage, which
come to men only as they came to the Lord Himself in the secret communion
of prayer and meditation, and through that independence of spirit which
arises from the sense of God&rsquo;s presence to guide us and to uphold.</p>
<p>Take your own case.&nbsp; If you are living here simply according
to traditional rules, doing this or that because, as you may be told,
everybody does it; accepting standards of conduct and rules of practice,
because, as you understand, or, as some one undertakes to persuade you,
they have always been so <!-- page 42--><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>accepted,
why, then, you are growing up to be one of that never-ending succession
of men who are the Pharisees, the opponents of the Christ, in every
generation, who live with tame conscience in any sort of company, and
perpetuate the bad traditions of the world.</p>
<p>But if you listen to the call of Christ, and have truly learned to
feel that the only real man&rsquo;s life is that which you live with
the light of God&rsquo;s law shining upon it, then, as a matter of course,
you will rise superior to the influence of any tradition or custom,
no matter what its authority may seem to be.</p>
<p>And it will indeed be a happy thing for you if you grow up with that
God-given strength of character and purpose which can treat all traditions,
and all usages, or fashions, or customs as things that should be subordinated,
and should not rule us, as things to be used by us if they help us to
a better life, but to be flung aside and rejected, if they contradict
the voice of God in our hearts.</p>
<h2><!-- page 43--><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>V.&nbsp; VAIN HOPES.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And he said, Nay, father Abraham: but if one went
unto them from the dead, they will repent.&nbsp; But he said, If they
hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though
one rose from the dead.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Luke </span>xvi.
30, 31.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is by no means uncommon for any one who is living a life which
does not satisfy his own conscience to console himself with the fancy
that if only such and such things were different around him he would
be a new man, filled with a new spirit, and exhibiting a new character.&nbsp;
But is it so very certain that this would be the case?</p>
<p>Such persons are apt to dream of some goodness or some virtue which
under other circumstances they would make their own; and there are,
in fact, few conditions more dangerous than that of this class of dreamers,
<!-- page 44--><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>whether among boys
or men.&nbsp; To all who may be tempted in this way, our Lord&rsquo;s
words in the parable come with a very significant warning: &ldquo;Nay,
father Abraham: but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.&nbsp;
But he said, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they
be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When insidious and delusive hope would draw us on and beguile us
in any sinful way, whispering that God will some day send special gifts
and messengers of grace to inspire us with new life, this is his plain
answer: &ldquo;If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will
they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And hardly any one can say that he is altogether free from this tendency
to lean upon the future with vain hopes, and is in no need of the warning
which this text conveys to us.</p>
<p>In serious moments, when the mind is calm, and neither passion nor
appetite is stirring, we feel how good a thing it <!-- page 45--><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>is
to have crucified the flesh and to be living close to Christ; but when
we are within the fiery circle of trial or temptation, when sinful desires
arise, or passions are strong, or solicitations to evil are subtle and
enticing, then we are only too ready to catch at any hopes about the
vague future.&nbsp; To the unstable and incontinent, to those whose
nature is weak while their conscience is not dead, this hope is a dangerous
temptation, beguiling them with the suggestion that some day there will
open before them an easy path to that virtue or self-denial to which
the way is too rough at present.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nay, father Abraham: but
if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.&rdquo;&nbsp;
By-and-by, they say, as they dream about the future, God will lay His
hand upon them; the Holy Spirit will touch their souls with new life;
they will receive in some inscrutable way new power, and in the exercise
of this power they will cast off the bondage of sin or weakness; but
how and by what means this <!-- page 46--><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>great
and necessary change is to be brought about they do not stop to think,
and meanwhile they yield to worldly or fleshly appetite, trusting vaguely
to an uncertain future for some Divine gift.</p>
<p>If you look into the thoughts and habits of your life, some of you
may be compelled to acknowledge that this case is not unfamiliar to
you.&nbsp; So men sometimes dally with a temptation, and linger beside
it, courting its company, instead of flinging it away from them, as
the snare of the devil, because of some secret hope that by-and-by God
will place them out of the way of it, or give them some new strength
against it, which as yet has not been given.&nbsp; How easy it is for
us to entice ourselves in this way out of the narrow path of present
duty into the tangled wilderness of a weak and sinful life, from which
escape becomes every day more difficult.</p>
<p>And this enticement along the ways of sin being so easy, it may be
happening to <!-- page 47--><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>some of
you.&nbsp; You may feel that, judged even by your own standard, which
is more likely to be too low than too high, your life is somehow unsatisfactory;
your better instincts may be telling you that you were born for something
higher, purer, stronger than what you are or have been; and you are
cherishing the hope that it will be different with you some day; your
circumstances, you think, or your occupation, or your companionship
will have changed, and so you fondly imagine that you yourself will
be sure to change, as if your soul were just a weathercock that answers
to every changing breeze.&nbsp; So perhaps you hope that some habit
of self-indulgence or idleness will drop off, or some evil temper be
eradicated; and whilst all this vague and mischievous dreaming goes
on you yield very likely to some besetting sin, making no serious effort
to get away from it now, and you yield all the more because of this
misleading hope that some day you will be touched by a supernatural
hand, and <!-- page 48--><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>will rise
up to a regenerate life.&nbsp; And yet our reason tells us that all
this is the very essence of self-deceit, and that such dreams and hopes
are the devil&rsquo;s most subtle temptation.&nbsp; This kind of vain
hope is based on a complete misconception of the nature of our conflict
with sin, and the way to escape from it.&nbsp; To think thus of spiritual
gifts and the growth of the spiritual life, is to follow a very dangerous
delusion.&nbsp; It was just such a misunderstanding that is expressed
in the hope of Dives about his brethren: &ldquo;If one went unto them
from the dead, they will repent.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their ordinary daily teachings,
he seems to say, the voice of Moses and of the prophets, the examples
of good men around them, the warnings, the exhortations, these, being
so familiar, may not have startled them out of their sin; but if only
one were to go to them from the dead, some messenger of strange voice
and aspect, who had seen hell, and could paint its horrors, then surely
the course of their life would be <!-- page 49--><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>checked
and changed, and their spirit would wake up in them, and they would
sin no more.&nbsp; But to all this comes back the stern warning of the
Divine answer: &ldquo;If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither
will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we may profitably consider what this means in its application
to our own life.&nbsp; Such a warning is evidently meant to remind us
that the mystery of sin in human life is not to be got rid of by any
such reliance on vague hopes.&nbsp; This mystery of sin in the heart
and life, misleading, weakening, dragging us down, means in fact the
subtle, poisonous, creeping power which evil inclinations exercise over
a weak and depraved will.&nbsp; Are we, then, to trust to some sudden
visitation from above, for which we make no preparation, to break down
or overthrow a power of this kind?&nbsp; On the contrary, the words
of this parable stand here to declare to us that it is nothing less
than perversity and folly in <!-- page 50--><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>any
man to go on either defiling his nature, or degrading it, or even neglecting
to strengthen and support it, under this delusion that some day the
breath of Heaven will sweep it clean or give it new vigour.&nbsp; And
your own experience is in exact accordance with these parabolic warnings
of the Saviour.&nbsp; You know that your moral and spiritual nature
is now at this present time undergoing a process of continual and momentous
change, that every day, or week, or month leaves its mark upon it; and
that your soul&rsquo;s life means not waiting for some angel of God&rsquo;s
providential grace to visit you and carry you up into a new air; but
it means that you are weaving the web of your unchangeable destiny by
your use or abuse of the gifts of God that are in your hands to-day.</p>
<p>Born into the world with the taint of inherited corruption in us,
as also with the germs of pure affection and high instinct and purpose,
we have to take care <!-- page 51--><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>for
ourselves and for each other that the taint does not eat out the good,
by growing into sins of boyhood or of youth, or by hardening into depraved
habits in our manhood.&nbsp; If we let our youth take an unhappy downward
course, whether in taste or habit, every day puts salvation farther
off from us, because every day any fault which is indulged or nursed
tends to grow deeper and more inveterate; and yet, forgetting this,
how many, while their early years are running to waste, nurse the vain
hope that some day they will receive the sudden baptism of a new birth.</p>
<p>So, then, instead of vaguely trusting, any of us, to the hope of
what some future call or help or happy visitation may do for us, let
us obey the Divine injunction, which, when rightly understood, is very
pressing, urging us, as we hope to see good days, to be very jealous
of our present life and its tendencies; let us do this, standing always
firm and immovable in the things that are pure and of good report.</p>
<p><!-- page 52--><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>However it may be
in some other matters, in this matter of our moral and spiritual life,
the greatest, the most important, the most serious thing of all, it
is almost invariably true that the child is father of the man, and we
feel that we have no right to expect it to be otherwise.&nbsp; In our
everyday consideration of life, we recognise all this: we speak of growth
in character and formation of habit as facts which no one would ignore,
and which cannot be overestimated.&nbsp; But to acknowledge these, and
at the same time to trust that God will hereafter arrest any stream
of sinful tendency in us which we ourselves do not attempt to stop now,
is to add presumption to sin.</p>
<p>When we speak of Heaven and Hell, we have in our thoughts the vision
of those ultimate points towards which the diverging courses of men&rsquo;s
lives are slowly tending day by day.&nbsp; And the question rises: &ldquo;On
which of these lines is my life travelling at the present time, and
<!-- page 53--><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>towards which side
of the impassable gulf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At present we know that the way of Christ is still open before us,
and that He calls us with a voice which never grows weary; but we feel
equally that the future is dark, if we waste or misuse the present,
and we do not know how long the heavenward path may be as open, or as
easy, as it is to-day.&nbsp; For the question is not a question of God&rsquo;s
untiring patience or the never-failing love of Christ.&nbsp; It is not
how long will His Spirit continue to strive with us, as it has striven
hitherto, through the care and love of parent or friend, through the
exhortations or efforts of a teacher, or the example of a companion,
or in a thousand other ways.&nbsp; The question is rather whether it
is not folly to expect that God will send upon us some other more powerful
regenerating and strengthening influence, if we are now neglecting all
this care and love and patient striving on our behalf.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
<!-- page 54--><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>they hear not Moses
and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from
the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Consider these things while life is fresh, and good influences are
present with you.&nbsp; Whatever our faults may be, they all come under
this one rule, that to-day is given us to win our freedom from their
power&mdash;to-day and not to-morrow.&nbsp; The question which is pressed
home through the warning of this parable is thus a very plain one: &ldquo;What
is my future hope or prospect, if I let this or that particular sin
lurk and linger in my heart, feeding upon me every day, and growing
stronger in consequence?&nbsp; What if I do not resist any fault that
has a hold upon me?&nbsp; What if I do not pray to be delivered from
it?&nbsp; What if I do not flee from it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If you hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will you be persuaded,
though one rose from the dead.</p>

in which God expected to find such a servant as Elijah, and that there
should be no indefinite tarrying, no lingering without an aim in such
a solitude.</p>
<p>As you read the familiar history you see how the record of the prophet&rsquo;s
retirement and his vision in Horeb is a record, first of all, of reaction
after fierce conflict; it exhibits the picture of a strong man in a
moment of weakness ready to give up the hopeless struggle, crying to
God, &ldquo;It is enough, now, O Lord, take away my life;&rdquo; and
then it shows us how God dealt with him in that solitude; <!-- page 56--><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>we
hear the Divine voice pleading in him again, bearing its Divine witness,
putting its searching questions, teaching him the universal lesson that
despondency, weakness, solitude, shrinking and retiring, if they have
any place in our life, are only for a time, and must not be allowed
to rule in it.</p>
<p>That Divine vision which came to Elijah in the recesses of the mountain
is, in fact, the voice of God summoning him back to the duties that
were waiting for him, and the renewal of his strength for the new work
he had to do.&nbsp; And the interest of such a vision never fails, because,
like Elijah, all men come to times when they too lie under the juniper
tree in the wilderness longing to be set free from the burden which
is too heavy for them, be it the burden of some call, or work, or duty,
or of resistance to some temptation, or the struggle against sin or
vice.&nbsp; It comes to all of us, and not once only, but many times
over, this hour of darkness; and it will continue to come so long as
the flesh is weak.&nbsp; And it is at such moments that a man is the
better for going <!-- page 57--><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>with
the prophet into this Horeb, the mount of God, making Elijah&rsquo;s
vision his own vision, and renewing his strength, at the same Divine
source.&nbsp; How often it happens to men, to boys, to all alike, that
they flee into the desert, away from the post of present duty, away
from the face of difficulties which they cannot or will not stand up
against, away from the moments of trial and discipline.&nbsp; And, seeing
that our life is not and cannot be a solitary thing, seeing that the
pulsations of each individual&rsquo;s life are creating other pulsations
which answer them back in other lives, we know not where or how many,
whenever we thus shrink away from our duty, when we turn our back upon
it, or despond about it, when we become deaf to the higher calls, we
are, in fact, crying to God to be relieved of our service to Him and
to our fellows.&nbsp; And it is a happy thing for our life if He does
not answer us according to our cry, and let us go into the wilderness,
and leave us alone there.</p>
<p>This voice, following us with the question, <!-- page 58--><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>&ldquo;What
doest them here?&rdquo; is the evidence that God has not abandoned us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doest thou here, Elijah?&rdquo;&nbsp; How often must
this voice have followed the monk into his solitude, refusing to be
silenced, piercing through all the false notions about a man&rsquo;s
relationship to his fellow-men, warning each soul that it cannot separate
itself from the great tide of universal life.</p>
<p>And the voice comes to us, the same warning voice of God, whenever
we stand aloof and let the tide around us run on anyhow, as if we didn&rsquo;t
care how it ran, or whenever in obedience to any impulse, whether of
selfishness or of timidity, we try to persuade ourselves that some duty
may be left alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doest thou here, Elijah?&rdquo;&nbsp; The quality of
our life depends on the answer we give to such spiritual questioning
day by day; for the Divine voices are never silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doest thou here?&rdquo;&nbsp; The voice cries to us when
we linger in the neighbourhood of any sin, or when we waste our opportunities
in some form of idleness, or when we stand by <!-- page 59--><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>in
cold or timid indifference, refusing help or consolation to any soul
which seems to need it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What doest thou here?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is possible that some
of us hardly like to shape our answer in plain words lest we might have
to say: &ldquo;I am here lingering in my present way of life, not because
I feel it to be the right way, but because it is the easy way, and I
cannot bring myself to face the harder and more manly course of duty.&nbsp;
I hear the voice; I cannot get away from it; it haunts me with its inquiries,
when my heart is hot within me, as it is sometimes, while yet I am burying
the light that is in my soul.&rdquo;&nbsp; If it should be so with any
of you, consider, I pray you, how by such hanging back you strengthen
the force of evil in the world and weaken the good.</p>
<p>As the hour of reaction, weakness, flight, came to Elijah, so we
must expect it to come to any of us; but the aim and purpose of our
life should be that in such an hour we may be able to answer our Heavenly
Father when He questions us, as Elijah was able to answer: &ldquo;I
<!-- page 60--><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>have been very jealous
for the Lord God of Hosts.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we live as those who are
jealous for God and His law, letting it be known and felt that we are
thus jealous for His honour, not one of us could fail to make the life
around us in some degree better, brighter, happier.</p>
<p>It is in this way that he who is strong and true makes truth and
honour and uprightness stronger in those beside him; it is in this way
that he who is industrious, as a duty, makes industry more prevalent;
it is in this way that he who shows his hatred of impurity makes the
atmosphere pure in his society.</p>
<p>And in so far as any of you are acting in this way you are doing
a prophet&rsquo;s work, and you, too, may claim to have been jealous
for the Lord God of Hosts.&nbsp; So the youngest boy and the oldest
man may become fellow-labourers&mdash;&Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&upsilon;
y&alpha;&rho; &epsilon;&sigma;&mu;&epsilon;&nu; &sigma;&upsilon;&nu;&epsilon;&rho;y&omicron;&iota;&mdash;fellow-labourers
in the harvest-field of God, and it is a great privilege to claim.</p>
<p>But the blessing of it is greater still.&nbsp; Very often, if you
are known to be thus jealous, even <!-- page 61--><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>your
presence will banish sin, silencing the evil tongue, strengthening the
weaker brother, and making the sunshine of a new life to shine all round
you.</p>
<p>But what if sometimes you feel that you are not equal to all this?
if when the voice cries, &ldquo;What doest thou here?&rdquo; you have
no answer to give?&nbsp; It is good for us in such a case to turn and
see how God dealt with His prophet, how He made him come forth and stand
on the mount before him.&nbsp; The Lord passed over him, revealing His
presence in the wind, the earthquake, and the fire, revealing it yet
more intimately in the sound of the still small voice.&nbsp; So He sent
Him out again with a new commission; and so we, too, may learn our lesson,
if we care to learn it.&nbsp; And the lesson is this, that God renews
our wavering strength, that He lifts up our drooping spirit, and opens
our dull eyes and gives us afresh the hearing ear, by communion with
Himself.&nbsp; In the solitude of the mount of God, through the symbols
of His power, and in the sound of the inner voices, in meditation, in
prayer, we may <!-- page 62--><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>find
those refreshing influences which give us new strength, new thoughts,
new notions of God and duty, and send us out afresh to do His work in
new service to Him.</p>
<p>We may follow His teaching to Elijah a little further.&nbsp; The
new message to him began, &ldquo;Return on thy way&rdquo;&mdash;do such
and such things.&nbsp; The new message is, in fact, just as always,
a new call to old duties&mdash;&ldquo;Return on thy way.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And so it is for you and me.&nbsp; After the vision of God comes the
plain and homely work to do, as we walk in old ways, and have to meet
all our old dangers and difficulties.&nbsp; Has any one of us ever shrunk
from any post of duty in life, or strayed from any straight course?&nbsp;
Then if God has in His mercy visited us with the warning call, &ldquo;What
doest thou here?&rdquo; or laid the call of a new message upon us, it
is almost sure to have been a call to return and take the straight path,
or to take our stand at the deserted post.&nbsp; And if it should ever
happen to us that the duty which looks too hard is, as indeed it happens
very often, some duty of <!-- page 63--><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>our
social life, should we feel as if the world were against us, and we
were standing alone, let us not forget God&rsquo;s word of final encouragement
to his prophet, &ldquo;Yet have I left me seven thousand in Israel who
have not bowed to Baal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is a word for all time.&nbsp; If ever you are fighting for the
good, and growing weary in the fight, the thought may rise in you that
you seem to be fighting alone, and that everything is against you, just
because you cannot see the seven thousand who are in the same ranks,
and on your side.</p>
<p>In the darkest hour of Israel&rsquo;s history we are thus told of
an indefinite multitude who had stood firm in the faith of their fathers,
untouched and untainted by adverse influence, and the recollection of
it should serve to strengthen and encourage every individual who is
really jealous for that which is good.</p>
<p>Let us, then, take the warning, and nurse it as a gift of God, and
go forward where duty calls us, sometimes faint, it may be, and sometimes
weary, but still pursuing.</p>
<h2><!-- page 64--><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>VII.&nbsp; PRIVATE
PRAYER, AND PUBLIC WORSHIP.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue
on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Luke </span>iv.
16.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He went out, and departed into a solitary place, and there
He prayed.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Mark </span>i. 35.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These two texts set before us our Saviour&rsquo;s habit in regard
to public and private spiritual exercise; and they suggest to us the
question, What have we, on our part, to say of these two elements in
our own life?&nbsp; These texts, we bear in mind, represent not something
casual or intermittent in the life of our Lord.&nbsp; They stand in
the record of it as a typical, essential, inseparable part of His habitual
practice.&nbsp; What we have to remember about them is that, whereas
all men recognise in the life of Jesus the one unique example in human
history of a life which is morally perfect and immaculate, if we were
to take these out of it, the <!-- page 65--><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>customary
share in all common worship, and the private, separate communing with
God, it would be an altogether different life&mdash;different in its
attitude towards the common life of ordinary men, and different in its
own quality and influence.</p>
<p>We might still admire&mdash;nay, we could not but admire&mdash;all
the beauty of moral qualities, the purity, the sympathy, the love and
self-devotion of it; but it would have lost its spiritual atmosphere.&nbsp;
It would no longer be for us the life of the Divine Son, recognising
and ready to share in all our attempts at worshipping the Father, however
poor they may be, and living through the separate life in daily communion
with Him.</p>
<p>Here then is His practice, written for our guidance, given that we
may be stirred by it to aim upwards, inviting us to set our own practice
side by side with it, and see how it looks in such a juxtaposition.&nbsp;
Let us glance for a moment at each of these texts separately.</p>
<p>As regards the one which I have taken from St. Mark&mdash;&ldquo;He
went out, and departed into <!-- page 66--><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>a
solitary place, and there He prayed&rdquo;&mdash;we have only to turn
over the pages of this Gospel and note, as we go, the similar allusions,
and we feel that we have here what is in fact an incidental glimpse
into the habitual practice of His secret and separate life.</p>
<p>In this passage we read that He departed into a solitary place, and
there He prayed; in another by-and-by that He departed into a mountain
to pray; and then again that He spent the whole night in prayer; and
we see all this not in some crisis of His life, but as a part of that
which corresponds to the common daily round in your life or mine.</p>
<p>And the inference to be drawn, the lesson to be learnt from it, is,
I think, sufficiently obvious.</p>
<p>This secret separate devotional exercise of the soul was His habitual
spiritual food.</p>
<p>It was thus that He recruited His moral and spiritual forces, those
forces of the spiritual life which constitute at once the beauty, the
attraction, the power of His character, and His divine and awe-inspiring
separateness.</p>
<p><!-- page 67--><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>And as we read and
consider, the thought must surely be pressed upon us that if He needed
these exercises, these secret and silent hours, what shall we say of
our own lives?</p>
<p>And what do we expect to make of our moral and spiritual character
unless we too are careful to cherish under all circumstances some such
recurring moments in our round of life and occupation, at which we retire
into the sanctuary of separate communion with God the Father?</p>
<p>You may take it as a moral certainty, proved by all experience, that
unless you hold to a fixed habit of thus bringing your life into the
secret and separate presence of God, in private prayer and thought,
you incur the risk of sinking to any levels that happen to be the ordinary
levels, and of drifting with any currents that happen to prevail.</p>
<p>If we turn now from this to the other text&mdash;that which refers
to His customary attendance on public prayer and at the common meeting&mdash;&ldquo;He
went, as His custom was, into <!-- page 68--><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>the
synagogue&rdquo;&mdash;the questions suggested are very pertinent and
practical.</p>
<p>Just consider the circumstances under which, as we are told here,
&ldquo;He went, as His custom was, into the synagogue on the Sabbath
day.&rdquo;&nbsp; The earlier part of the same chapter tells us of His
fasting and temptation in the wilderness, of the commencement of His
public mission, and his return to Nazareth.&nbsp; And, on His return,
this is what we are told of him&mdash;&ldquo;He went, as his custom
was, into the synagogue on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we see Him, fresh from the great crisis of His early manhood;
the long, protracted struggle of His soul in the lonely wilderness;
the subtle voices of manifold temptation; the hardly won victory and
the ministering angels; all this we must suppose to be still flashing
across His vision, as the scenes of any such crisis must always continue
to flash through the quivering and responsive organism of the soul.</p>
<p>If ever any man might have claimed to need no longer the customary
worship of common <!-- page 69--><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>men,
it was surely Jesus, as we see Him here on this occasion, with the breath
of His own heart-searching worship still upon Him, and the light of
new revelation burning in His thoughts.</p>
<p>Among all the significant and instructive parts of the Saviour&rsquo;s
example this is not the least instructive; that on this occasion, as
on all others, he went as a matter of regular custom into the synagogue
on the Sabbath day, thus putting the seal and stamp of His own practice
for all of us who believe in His name upon the duty of joining in habitual
and stated spiritual exercises.</p>
<p>Had the Lord&rsquo;s example been different in this respect, how
easy it would have seemed to set up a string of what we should have
called sufficient reasons.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned routine, it might have been said, of synagogue
worship, with its mechanical dulness and its mistaken interpretations
of God&rsquo;s word, its shallow and superficial and tedious traditional
commentaries, its formalism and vain repetitions; <!-- page 70--><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>all
this, whatever might have been its value for the ordinary unenlightened
Jew, how could it have been necessary and what profit could there have
been in it for the divinely gifted Son of man?</p>
<p>So it might have been argued; so indeed it would seem men who consider
themselves enlightened sometimes argue in support of their own neglect
of the religious life.</p>
<p>But it may well make us more than doubtful as to the issue of any
such neglect, when we see the mind of Christ thus exemplified in His
habitual observance.</p>
<p>We all recognise His moral and spiritual superiority.&nbsp; Whether
His spirit has taken possession of our spirit or not, He stands out
as our undisputed guide to the practice of a good life.</p>
<p>In vision, in insight, in purity, in stainlessness, in all that we
reverence in human life and that good men strive to attain, we have
no model to set beside His example.&nbsp; All the more, then, this fact
deserves our notice, and calls us to follow Him, that we <!-- page 71--><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>find
Him, as His custom was, in the synagogue on the Sabbath day.&nbsp; He
was there Sabbath after Sabbath listening to the provincial teacher,
worshipping with the village labourer, praying with the ignorant and
the foolish, there as a matter of life custom and for His soul&rsquo;s
benefit.</p>
<p>I have said that it deserves our notice; but more than this&mdash;it
should be graven on the minds of the young, so that they may never lose
the impression of it, so that it go with them through all their years
of manhood, to preserve in them the devotional and reverent habit.</p>
<p>It is indeed good for all of us to think of Him there in that primitive
and unattractive house of God, listening to the rude Galilean accents,
and bowing His head in the habitual worship of that obscure community.</p>
<p>I do not think it is possible for us, unless we are quite indifferent
about our moral and spiritual condition&mdash;unless, that is, we have
low notions about our life, a low aim and a low standard&mdash;to be
unaffected in our practice <!-- page 72--><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>by
this example of the Lord.&nbsp; We can hardly believe that those exercises
of the spirit which were so fruitful in His life will fail to bear their
fruit in ours also.</p>
<p>What have we to say as we picture Him with all the great thoughts
of His new work swelling up in His soul, the divinely appointed teacher
of new wisdom and new faith, the bringer of new light among men, the
voice of a new world, and yet, being all this, at the same time, and
as a means for working out His mission more completely, a regular and
devout worshipper in a village house of prayer?</p>
<p>If it should ever happen to any of us that we come to fancy we do
not need such common prayer, or that because of defects in public worship
we do not profit by it, does not this example of the Saviour rise up
and rebuke us?&nbsp; Yes, you may rest assured, if that day ever comes
to you, that you are in danger of drifting away from the great saving
tides of the human spirit into some shallow or artificial stream of
your own time and generation.&nbsp; But, on the other hand, it is a
happy thing for our <!-- page 73--><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>life
if, growing up in the habitual use of time-honoured spiritual exercises,
we have truly learnt to know by our own experience, as by the example
of the Saviour set before us in the Gospel, that they are the support
and safeguard of all that is highest and purest and best in us, if only
we are careful to use them with sincerity and reverence.</p>
<h2><!-- page 74--><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>VIII.&nbsp; AN
UNANSWERABLE QUESTION.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?&nbsp;
Not one.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Job </span>xiv. 4.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is one of those simple questions which, by their very simplicity
and directness, set us thinking about the importance of our personal
life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?&rdquo;&nbsp;
But all our common life is somehow the outcome of our separate individual
lives&mdash;of your life and mine.&nbsp; Therefore how important it
is in the common interest that each of us should look above all things
to his own life and its character, for this will determine his contribution
to the life of his society.</p>
<p>Nearly all men are keen about the reputation of their society, about
the name it <!-- page 75--><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>bears,
about the way in which men think and speak of it.</p>
<p>Thus you are no doubt sensitive, almost every one of you, about the
good reputation of your school or your house, or any society with which
you may happen to be closely connected or identified.</p>
<p>And this is a healthy and praiseworthy feeling.&nbsp; It would indeed
be a bad sign if such a feeling were wanting or weak in any society.</p>
<p>But I am not sure that we keep it before us&mdash;all of us&mdash;as
clearly as we ought to do, that this reputation of the society is simply
the outcome of our separate lives and habits.</p>
<p>The reputation is the reflex of the life; hardly ever, perhaps, an
exact reflex, very often a distorted reflex with this or that feature
exaggerated; but yet always a reflex.</p>
<p>The reputation you bear is the impression made by your common life
on the minds of those who see it from the outside, or who hear men&rsquo;s
talk about it.</p>
<p><!-- page 76--><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>And we do well to
be sensitive on such a subject; but we do still better if we bear in
mind that this common life is what comes out of our own life, and is
the result of its contact with that of our neighbour.</p>
<p>And with this thought in our minds we feel how searching and how
directly personal is this primitive and childlike question, Who can
bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</p>
<p>Societies, especially young societies, are very impressible, and
their character&mdash;the quality, that is, of their life&mdash;is fixed
by prevailing influences, which show themselves in fashions, habits,
and tendencies, in the common types of thought, or taste, or behaviour,
or conduct.</p>
<p>This is obvious enough to every one; but what we do not seem always
to consider is the extent to which these influences or fashions have
their origin, so far as our own society is concerned, in our own lives.&nbsp;
They are, in fact, in the main the general outcome of our separate lives.</p>
<p><!-- page 77--><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>Do you, then, think
of yourselves&mdash;this is the practical question to which these considerations
lead up&mdash;as sources or centres of such influence, contributing
your personal share to this common life?</p>
<p>It may make an immense difference to all your thoughts about your
common habits, and your standards of daily conduct and duty, if you
remember this ancient saying, that no man can bring a clean thing out
of an unclean.&nbsp; And so I have to ask you to consider a little how
the common life of this society is dependent upon your life.</p>
<p>Every individual acts upon the life of the community around him as
a power or influence in it.&nbsp; This seems so obvious when mentioned
as hardly to deserve the mentioning, and yet in practice we are very
apt to overlook it.</p>
<p>You and I, all of us, without any exception, are endowed with some
share of this power.</p>
<p>In this respect, as in other ways, there is, of course, every possible
difference in <!-- page 78--><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>degree
between one and another, between the strong and the weak, between those
who are conspicuous and those who are obscure; but there is no other
difference.</p>
<p>Every one of you possesses some share of this mysterious, and undefined,
and immeasurable gift of influencing his neighbour&rsquo;s life.&nbsp;
Every sin that may have a root in your heart is acting, though you may
not think of it or intend it, as a pestilent influence outside your
own life; every virtue you exercise may be causing similar virtues to
take root and grow in some one near to you.</p>
<p>The tone of the society or life around you is, in fact, just the
sum and expression of such individual influences as these.</p>
<p>We may not be able to trace all the various and multitudinous germs
or seeds of such influence as they flow out from us in our daily round
of common life; but we are conscious that each and every single soul,
all through its earthly course, in the family and in the outer world,
from youth to age, is, in fact, a sower scattering these germs of good
<!-- page 79--><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>or evil unceasingly.&nbsp;
We know, also, that when they are once scattered they cannot be gathered
up again.&nbsp; They are yours to scatter&mdash;these seeds that you
are adding to the common life&mdash;and you are responsible for the
fruit they bear; but having sown them, you are powerless afterwards
to prevent them from bearing fruit after their kind in other lives.&nbsp;
Once launched in the air around you, they spread their contagion of
evil or their stimulus to good, their savour of life or death.</p>
<p>The mere suspicion of this undefined power over other lives which
is inherent in our own life should surely make us very careful about
it.</p>
<p>It gives a new sense of personal responsibility; it lays its hand
upon us to check us in any vice, or folly, or sin; and it is a stimulus
to every virtue and to all good purposes.</p>
<p>But the thing which of all others it is perhaps of most importance
for us to remember about it is that this stream of our personal <!-- page 80--><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>influence
which flows out of our life is a double stream.&nbsp; It is of two kinds.&nbsp;
One part of it flows unconsciously, whether we think of it or not; it
streams out from our personality as sunlight from the sun.</p>
<p>The other is that which we exercise by some conscious effort of the
will, and with some deliberate purpose or intention.</p>
<p>Now, in the case of most of us, this tide of unconscious influence
flowing from us without any deliberate or set purpose on our part, our
involuntary contribution to the common life, is far more powerful for
good or for evil than anything which we ever do by way of active purpose
to influence another&rsquo;s life, and this because our unconscious
influence is the reflex on the outer world of what we are in ourselves;
it is the projection, or shall we say the radiation, of our own life,
its tastes, tempers, habits, and character, upon the lives around us.</p>
<p>What we do or intend to do, what influence we endeavour to exercise,
is very likely to be at the best intermittent, but <!-- page 81--><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>this
door of involuntary communication between every man&rsquo;s life and
his neighbour&rsquo;s life is always standing open; and so it comes
about that your life, whether public or private, is of more importance
to others than anything else about you.</p>
<p>At a time when so many things contribute to fix men&rsquo;s thoughts
on externals, and we are all tempted to think more about our work than
about our life, more about what we are doing or intending to do, than
of what we are in ourselves, these considerations assume an unusual
importance.</p>
<p>Moreover, in a society like this, where you live so close to one
another, and so much in public, there is a special reason for giving
to such considerations some special attention; and the thought suggested
by this world-old inquiry&mdash;Who can bring a clean thing out of an
unclean?&mdash;becomes a very direct warning to look well to our separate
life, and take care what sort of unconscious influences it is spreading
around it.</p>
<p>A moment&rsquo;s reflection will remind you how <!-- page 82--><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>quick
and strong such influences may easily prove, independent of all intention
or desire on our part, or even in spite of our deliberate wishes or
hopes.&nbsp; One man is careless or irreligious, and his weaker neighbours
catch the infection of his example; another indulges in some bad habits
of language or conduct, or he is addicted to some low taste, or he lives
by some low standard, and this or that companion is drawn down to his
level; and so the evil of his life takes fresh root in another life,
and it gets into the air, and it is impossible to predict the limit
of its influence.</p>
<p>Or, on the other hand, one man is intellectual or refined in his
tastes, and by merely living in a society he creates an atmosphere of
intellect or of refinement around him; or, it may be, he is earnest
and courageous, and others are drawn to admire and imitate, and so he
proves a centre of courage and earnestness.&nbsp; Such is the solidarity
of your life, as men call it, and there is no escape from it, or from
the responsibilities which it lays upon you.</p>
<p><!-- page 83--><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>As the tree is known
by its fruits, as men do not gather grapes of thorns, as the same fountain
does not send forth sweet water and bitter, so we have to remember,
when we think of the tides of unconscious influence that are continually
streaming out from us, that they are wholesome, or the reverse, according
to the character of our secret and separate life.</p>
<p>Through them any one of us may become to his neighbour or his friend
a savour of life unto life, or of death unto death.</p>
<p>There are sure to be many in such a congregation as this who have
visions of the good they hope to do; and there is a spirit of native
generosity in almost all which makes them shrink from the thought of
doing harm to another soul.</p>
<p>Well, then, in this thought of your influence, conscious and unconscious,
your first and constant prayer will surely be: &ldquo;Create in me a
clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effective servant of God is always the <!-- page 84--><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>man
who has been prepared and purified by the vision of God in his own soul.</p>
<p>If, then, we desire to contribute some good to our society and no
evil, we must take care to keep our hearts open to the cleansing influences
of the spirit of holiness, so that no habit of sin shall cast its dark
shadow around us, or vitiate that atmosphere which is inseparable from
our personal life.</p>
<h2><!-- page 85--><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>IX.&nbsp; SOWING
BESIDE ALL WATERS.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Isaiah
</span>xxxii. 20.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words form part of a great prophetic vision.&nbsp; The prophet
is standing among his countrymen like a watchman on the walls of Jerusalem.&nbsp;
And far away, as he looks, the distant horizon of his stormy sky is
bright with Messianic hopes, but around him the shadows lie dark and
heavy.</p>
<p>It was his destiny to speak to a people whose ears were dull of hearing
and their hearts without understanding; but he never lost the conviction
that the holy seed of God&rsquo;s spirit was alive in them.&nbsp; Amidst
all present discouragement he lived in the hope of a brighter and better
day, when the eyes of those around him would be opened, and their hearts
changed, and a new spirit would <!-- page 86--><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>take
hold of them, and righteousness, peace, prosperity, and gladness would
prevail.&nbsp; And no man&rsquo;s life is worth much which is not inspired
by some such hope.</p>
<p>What Isaiah saw immediately around him was sin and moral blindness.&nbsp;
What he saw immediately in front of him was the consequence of these
in woe and desolation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Year upon year,&rdquo; he cries,
&ldquo;shall ye be troubled, ye careless ones: thorns and briers shall
come upon the land of my people: until the spirit be poured upon us
from on high, and the wilderness shall become a planted field.&rdquo;&nbsp;
But in the day of that outpouring, the heart of the people would turn
and be uplifted, renewed, and purified, the wilderness would become
a planted field.&nbsp; And this thought brings him to the final outburst
of the text I have just read to you, which is a blessing on those true
Israelites who realised the high calling of God&rsquo;s people, and
were inspired to fulfil it, sowing everywhere and always the seeds of
Divine influence.&nbsp; The whole vision is highly <!-- page 87--><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>instructive,
for it is the vision of what occurs again and again in all human history;
but it is of this blessing with which it closes that I desire to say
a word or two to-day.</p>
<p>Amidst all the threatening and discouraging symptoms of the national
life, Isaiah turned to the bright vision of those servants of God whose
faith should never fail, and in whom there should be no variableness,
and no wavering.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Sow your seed of good influence, he seems to say to them, in good times,
in bad times; sow it in this place, and in every place, sow it in the
wastes of the moral wilderness, sow it in the face of every enemy, sow
it in faith and hope and without fear.&nbsp; It is on them he depends
to prepare for that happier season when the wilderness of the spiritual
life around him should become as a planted field; and with prophetic
insight he perceives that it is on such as these that the Divine blessing
always rests.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed are they that sow beside all waters.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is a text to be taken with <!-- page 88--><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>us
whenever any change comes over the circumstances of our life.&nbsp;
If we are changing from a life of rule or discipline to a life of free
choice, from school to home, from boyhood to manhood, this blessing
declares that there should be no change in the attitude and purpose
and aim of life.</p>
<p>It is another way of saying that the laws which should guide our
conduct, and the principles which should inspire and direct us, are
of universal application; that they know no difference of time or place,
and that if they bind you here they should bind you everywhere.&nbsp;
And simple and obvious as this may seem, it is not altogether an easy
truth to carry into practice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed are ye that sow beside
all waters.&rdquo;&nbsp; Your seed field is not here or there only;
it lies on every side of you, and in all places; it spreads into the
future farther than your eye can travel, and it will extend itself before
you as you go; and the reality and vigour of good purpose in you will
be determined by your recognition of this truth.</p>
<p><!-- page 89--><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>Let us consider
it with reference to our own case at such a time as this.</p>
<p>There are always growing up here in every generation those who feel
a pride in their school, and in the spirit of it, who strive honestly
and earnestly to sow in their society the seeds of manliness, and truthfulness,
and good tone, and purity.&nbsp; It would soon go very ill with this
or any other society if it were not so.&nbsp; And those who grow up
in this way are continually leaving us in their turn, and they will
remember with affection the place of their high purposes and earnest
and manly efforts.&nbsp; They go out into a new world, and travel along
other streams; and blessed are they, if they continue faithful, sowing
still beside all waters.</p>
<p>But every change brings with it some element of risk.&nbsp; There
is nearly always something of surprise to us in the new forces that
confront us in any society which we enter as strangers; and the first
feeling that rises is sometimes a feeling of our own weakness or insignificance.</p>
<p><!-- page 90--><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>In such a case it
is well if we have realised beforehand that our laws of conduct should
not vary, and that the call of God, which we have recognised once, is
a call which never ceases, and which no circumstances should make inaudible.</p>
<p>When we approach any change we all need this kind of warning; because
there are so many things in our life which we are apt to allow our circumstances
to regulate for us.&nbsp; Experience tells us only too plainly how much
we depend upon the influences that are around us, and how often we fail
to carry with us the strength we have gained in one field when we pass
over to the next.&nbsp; With the holy we learn in some degree to be
ourselves holy; with a perfect man we too are able to walk perfectly;
but on the other hand, in our imitative way, as the scene changes, we
sometimes find ourselves learning frowardness with the froward, practising
indifference with the indifferent, if not actually slipping with the
vicious into some vicious way.&nbsp; There is always some <!-- page 91--><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>risk
of such changes; and it is always well for us to be taking care that
our better life has its root in our own heart and spirit, and that we
do not wear it as a garment suited to the society in which we happen
to be, and change it for the worse, if there comes any corresponding
change in outward influences.</p>
<p>Hence it is that at these times, when we are about to separate, these
words of Isaiah come to us with a very appropriate reminder: &ldquo;Blessed
are ye that sow beside all waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To those who are leaving our society to begin a new life elsewhere,
as to those of us who go in the hope of returning by-and-by, they are
charged with the same lesson.&nbsp; They bid us all alike take care
and see that what is good in our present life has become our own personal
and permanent possession, independent of surroundings; that it has sunk
in some degree into the fibre of our character; that it is settled in
us by conviction and principle, to guide and direct us everywhere, and
is not merely <!-- page 92--><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>a circumstantial
garment, a sort of livery of this or that particular place, which will
slip off us as we leave it.</p>
<p>Many of you have learnt, I feel sure of it, to feel during these
your school days, the satisfaction of living here a true and worthy
life; you have tasted of that pleasure which the careless, the indifferent,
and the sinful hardly taste at all, the pleasure that dwells with the
consciousness of earnest effort and sincere striving after the best
things within us.&nbsp; The love of Christ may have taken hold upon
you; the associations of your school and its inheritance of great and
good examples, or the sense of honour may have stirred you; the feeling
of your closeness in life to those around you, and of the strong currents
of mutual influence, may have opened your eyes to what you owe to your
neighbour and to the claims of social duty.&nbsp; Some one of these
causes, or it may be some other cause, may have given you strength and
power to walk amongst us in the narrow way of good habit and good <!-- page 93--><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>influence.&nbsp;
And wherever this is so, we thank God.&nbsp; But the question to-day
is, What assurance do you feel that this will continue?&nbsp; When we
go elsewhere, what habits, what tendencies, what fixed bent of spirit
and character shall we exhibit?&nbsp; Knowing as we do how strongly
the forces of the outer world will act upon us, it is never a useless
warning which bids us take care that in new spheres we do not forget
our old principles, or lay aside any good habits.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blessed
are ye that sow beside all waters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have learnt to look upon certain laws of conduct and feeling,
certain duties, certain standards of life, as beyond dispute, and fundamental.&nbsp;
If so, they are also of universal application; and we should hold them
as things which are altogether independent of the customs, traditions,
or tone of any society into which we may go.</p>
<p>It is probable that some of you may find this doctrine not altogether
free from difficulties before many weeks are over.&nbsp; You may find
yourselves young and apparently <!-- page 94--><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>uninfluential
members of some society in which the standards of life are low, and
you may be tempted to think, under the pressure of surrounding opinion,
that you are not called upon to set up or display any standard of your
own; and there is always a chorus of voices ready enough to echo any
such tempting suggestions.</p>
<p>But if ever you are tempted thus to let slip the things you have
learnt and accepted, the voice of Isaiah should prove a help and a safeguard.&nbsp;
And its exhortation is supported by the respect and admiration you feel
for any one who has the courage to stand alone in such a case, true
to his rooted convictions.</p>
<p>Another word may be added.&nbsp; We met, a great many of us, this
morning at that table to which men do not come unless they entertain
the purpose of treading in the footsteps of Christ, and of nursing His
Holy Spirit in their hearts.&nbsp; As we lifted up our hearts there,
as we ate of that bread and drank of that cup, as we prayed to be kept
<!-- page 95--><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>safe from the sins
that most easily beset us, as we sealed in each other&rsquo;s presence
the resolutions which are to direct our steps in safe paths, it was
not of circumstances or places that we were thinking&mdash;it was the
vision of Christ our Saviour that was before our eyes, and we pray that
this vision may remain with us.&nbsp; When we think of all our diverging
paths as we separate just now, and of the uncertainty how many of us
may meet again in that far horizon, and how many may have wandered out
of the way in the wilderness, we do not doubt that we shall often need
the strengthening influence of this vision of Christ, if we, too, hope
to inherit the blessing which is reserved for those who are faithful
under all circumstances, and who sow beside all waters.</p>
<h2><!-- page 96--><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>X.&nbsp; THE PRESENCE
OF GOD.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And Jacob awakened out of his sleep and said,
Surely the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Genesis
</span>xxviii. 16.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words indicate the beginning of a new life in the patriarch
Jacob.&nbsp; They tell us of the moment when, as it would appear, his
soul awoke in him.&nbsp; And they surprise us in some degree, as such
awakenings of spiritual capacity often do; for Jacob&rsquo;s recorded
antecedents were not exactly such as to lead us to expect the dream
and the vision, and the awakening which are described in this passage.</p>
<p>He had cheated his brother out of his father&rsquo;s blessing; he
was leaving his father&rsquo;s house in consequence, to avoid this brother&rsquo;s
threatened vengeance; and as he slept at Bethel he dreamed his dream
of the ladder <!-- page 97--><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>set up
on earth and reaching to heaven; and he saw the angels ascending and
descending, and the Lord standing above it, and he heard the Divine
voice charged with promise and with blessing: &ldquo;I am with thee,
and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest.&rdquo;&nbsp; This,
taking it in all its parts, is a very surprising narrative; and the
point in it on which I desire to fix your attention for a moment is
this, that this vision startled him into a new consciousness&mdash;&ldquo;Surely
the Lord is in this place; and I knew it not.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the
beginning of a new life.</p>
<p>That vision, we may be sure, never entirely faded.&nbsp; He was never
afterwards the same man he had been before it.&nbsp; It had awakened
the divine capacity in him; and it remained with him as a constant reminder
of the presence of God in his life, to protect and to inspire him&mdash;&ldquo;I
am with thee, and I will keep thee in all places whither thou goest.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Such a voice as this in a man&rsquo;s heart gives his life a new quality;
it puts him in a new relation to all common things.</p>
<p><!-- page 98--><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>We may well believe
that it was this more than anything else which drew Jacob apart from
the common heathen life around him, from that day onwards.&nbsp; It
was this which, in spite of all his weaknesses, defects, and failures
in life and character, gradually raised him to a different level.</p>
<p>It was this which finally culminated in transforming him from Jacob
the supplanter to Israel the prince of God.</p>
<p>So far as appears, he had gone out from his home, as so many go forth
in all ages, a dull soul, though with latent capacities, his thoughts
bent on securing his personal safety and his worldly success.&nbsp;
But he woke in the desert after that vision, with the seeds of the new
life rooted and growing in him.</p>
<p>It is this moment of awakening on which I desire to fix your thoughts&mdash;this
moment of his transfiguration; when he saw and felt a heaven above him,
and yet very close, with its ladder of angelic communication, which
he had not <i>so</i> seen or felt before; <!-- page 99--><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>the
moment when a new consciousness flashed through his soul, and illumined
unsuspected chambers in it, stirring new thoughts and new aspirations.&nbsp;
He woke up to be a new man henceforth, moving in a new presence, and
having always in his ears the voice of a Divine call.</p>
<p>Do you ask why I dwell on this familiar history, or desire that you
should contemplate and realise this change in the young man Jacob?&nbsp;
It is because there is just the same soul, the same capacity of higher
life in every one of us: in some it is awake already and transfiguring
their life; in others still latent, sleeping, undiscovered.</p>
<p>I dwell on it because it makes and will make all the difference in
the world to your life whether in your case this capacity is awakened
or not.&nbsp; This, then, is what I have to postulate as giving a value
beyond the power of words to describe to every soul amongst us.</p>
<p>It bids us recognise and keep always before us that in every common
life, of child <!-- page 100--><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>or
man, even in the most worldly or the hardest, the most frivolous, the
most cynical, the most sensual, or the most degraded, there is latent,
it may be altogether unfelt and disregarded through long years, giving
no sign of its presence, it may be, it often is, overlaid, trodden down,
even at the point of death, but still there, this living soul with all
its possibilities.&nbsp; It is within every one of us, stamped with
the image of God, and charged with unimagined possibilities.</p>
<p>And it must be obvious that the whole difference between any two
lives, between your life and your neighbour&rsquo;s life, may depend
on this awakening of the soul in one of you and its not awakening in
the other.</p>
<p>Of the two brothers, Esau and Jacob, I suppose we are all drawn at
the outset to Esau; our heart goes out to him, as we read, the impulsive,
the impetuous, the affectionate, and we feel a corresponding dislike
of Jacob&rsquo;s craft and cunning, and selfish calculations.&nbsp;
There can be no doubt, we say, which was the meaner character to begin
with.</p>
<p><!-- page 101--><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>But neither is
there any doubt why it was that it came to be written, &ldquo;Jacob
I have loved, but Esau have I hated.&rdquo;&nbsp; The one was just the
child of the world around him, yielding to its temptations, living by
its standards.&nbsp; The soul in him never awoke, so as to transfigure
his thoughts and purposes.&nbsp; The other is a man of Divine visions,
inspired with the sense of a Divine presence and a Divine purpose directing
him.</p>
<p>Nowhere do we see more clearly than in this narrative how great a
change may come to any of us, if the unawakened capacities of our soul
are touched by the breath of some uplifting inspiration.</p>
<p>As we read of this contrast between Esau and Jacob, and their destinies,
we feel&mdash;and we feel it all the more because Jacob to begin with
seems to be made of such common clay&mdash;we feel what a transforming
power in a man&rsquo;s life this awaking of the soul may be.</p>
<p>A life which is without the inspiration that takes possession of
us in the moments of this <!-- page 102--><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>awakening,
and is consequently without these visions that flash before the soul
as it awakens, a life that is not deeply stirred by spiritual hopes
or Divine thought, or the call to new duty, remains in one man a selfish
and worldly life, in another a frivolous, in a third a sensual life.&nbsp;
But the very same life&mdash;and here is the practical value to us,
here is the hopefulness of such considerations&mdash;the very same life,
when the breath of God&rsquo;s spirit or His penetrating voice has stirred
and roused the soul in it, is felt to be transformed.&nbsp; The man
is born anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing finer,&rdquo; some one has said, &ldquo;than
to see a soul rise up in men, which amazes the very men in whom it rises.&rdquo;&nbsp;
They are surprised to find that these new capacities were in them, unnoticed
through their careless days, yet in them all the time.&nbsp; This birth
of the new life, with all its promise of new tastes, new ambitions,
new thoughts, new purposes, may indeed come to you without your feeling
all at once how great a thing it is.&nbsp; At first it may be nothing
more than some <!-- page 103--><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>vision
of the possibilities of your life, or some electric flash of new consciousness
that runs through you, or the sharp pang of remorse for some sin or
some neglect, or the flush of shame or repulsion as you think of something
or other in your life, or the glow of some good resolution to begin
some new life or new duty, or take some new turn, or pursue some new
aim.&nbsp; You hardly think perhaps of this as the awakening of your
soul.&nbsp; It may never have occurred to you to think of it as being
just as sacred a thing as was Jacob&rsquo;s vision at Bethel, as being
indeed the work of the same Divine spirit.</p>
<p>But let us consider it a little further.&nbsp; Whatever it is that
is thus stirring in your heart, it comes and it comes again; it lingers
in your thoughts and feelings; it haunts, it impresses and awes you;
it rises before you suddenly and stops you from some sin, or, if it
fails to stop you, it turns the pleasure for which you craved into wretchedness;
or it encourages and consoles you in some hour of weakness or sorrow.&nbsp;
I suppose there is hardly <!-- page 104--><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>one
of you who has not had some such experience as this.&nbsp; And if you
ask.&nbsp; What is it?&nbsp; It is, I repeat, the awakening of the soul
in you&mdash;nothing less than this&mdash;and happy is it for you, if
you recognise that it is the soul striving to win its proper place in
the regulation of your life.</p>
<p>When Moses saw the vision of the burning bush, and suddenly felt
himself on holy ground; when Elijah heard the still, small voice calling,
&ldquo;What doest thou here, Elijah?&rdquo; when Saul, on his way to
Damascus, fell to the ground conscience-smitten, crushed, blinded, rebuked;
when the child Samuel heard the Divine voice calling to him in the darkness
of the night;&mdash;in each case it was the awakening or the reawakening
of the soul&mdash;the uprising of the spiritual capacities, the vision
of the higher life&mdash;and so exactly with all of <i>you</i>.&nbsp;
Are you not sometimes conscious of the uprisings in you of a spirit
calling upon you to recognise the angels&rsquo; ladder that connects
<i>your</i> life also with the heaven above us?</p>
<p><!-- page 105--><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>If so, there is
this further thing to note about such moments of experience.</p>
<p>This feeling of some spiritual capacity in you, this call to some
higher view of life and duty, this uprising of the moral sense and the
repulsion towards the lower forms of life which comes with it&mdash;this
is God&rsquo;s personal gift to us, and we pray that you may possess
it early; for it is not only a new consciousness, it is itself a new
power in your life.</p>
<p>You cannot have it, feeling its presence and hearing its suggestions,
and debase your life in any way, as you might have done, but for its
presence.&nbsp; It is so very true that, in the life of the Spirit,
looking up means lifting up.&nbsp; As the plant turns to the sun, it
grows towards the sun; as it looks up to the light, it grows towards
the light; so it is with us.&nbsp; We feel that we are sons of God,
and we tend to become so.&nbsp; Through some influence or other, we
awake to a vivid consciousness that God has created us in His image,
endowed us with Divine capacities, and this <!-- page 106--><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>consciousness
becomes a purifying and inspiring force in our life, and it is a new
life in consequence.</p>
<p>Pray that such influences may prevail around you here, and that you
may hold them fast until they have blessed your life.</p>
<h2><!-- page 107--><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>XI.&nbsp; &ldquo;MEMBERS
ONE OF ANOTHER.&rdquo;</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and
every one members one of another.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Romans
</span>xii. 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There<span class="smcap"> </span>are some moral and spiritual truths
which it seems to be almost impossible to impress upon the practical
life of the world, although they meet with a sort of universal acceptance.</p>
<p>Men agree with them, they re-echo them, they applaud them; they do
everything, in fact, but exhibit them as the moving, inspiring, and
guiding truths of their daily practice.</p>
<p>And among these I fear we must still class that one which is expressed
in the text I have just read, a text which sets forth the fundamental
fact that whatever else Christianity may teach, it teaches as one of
its first and principal lessons that a Christian man has to live in
Christ for his neighbours.</p>
<p><!-- page 108--><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>If such a text
means anything, it means that Christianity is essentially a religion
of society, that it sets before us social claims as standing before
all other claims; that, starting from the Divine Sacrifice as the central
fact of human life, it was intended to root out of our hearts the noxious
weed of selfishness by the power of the Divine love, and to build up
the organisation of men in their common relationships upon this new
basis.</p>
<p>It may sound somewhat strange to speak at this time of day of what
Christianity is intended to do, rather than what it has done already.</p>
<p>But it is even more strange to read the teaching of the Sermon on
the Mount, and all the other words of the Lord; all the lessons of His
life and His sacrifice; the history of the first generation of Christians;
the descent of the Spirit upon them; and the teaching of the apostolic
brotherhood&mdash;to remember that all this is our accepted faith; that
it has been the faith of one generation after another for eighteen hundred
years; that <!-- page 109--><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>we grow
up in this faith, live in it, and die in it; and at the same time to
contemplate side by side with it all the elements of the common life,
all the rules and customs of society, all the standards of conduct which
ordinary men take as their measure of daily duty and purpose.</p>
<p>Thus, whilst on the one hand Christian influences, and all the changes
in the world&rsquo;s life which are due to them, fill us with wonder
and gratitude, the failures of Christianity are scarcely less impressive.</p>
<p>When we consider the ordinary run of men&rsquo;s lives, so different
for the most part in spirit, and in aim and guiding rules, from that
type which the New Testament sets before us, it would almost seem as
if to the majority their religion was not a ruling and dominating principle,
pervading this present life, but only an <i>ideal</i>, shedding around
us a glow of indefinite hopes and possibilities, an ideal hardly to
be realised, laid up somewhere in the heavens&mdash;&epsilon;&nu; &omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&alpha;&nu;&omega;
&iota;&sigma;&omega;&sigmaf; &pi;&alpha;&rho;&alpha;&kappa;&epsilon;&iota;&tau;&alpha;&iota;.&nbsp;
These contrasts between the revelation of the Gospel and the standards
<!-- page 110--><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>of the Christian
world have always troubled the most earnest spirits in every generation.&nbsp;
Some of you remember, no doubt, how this contrast between Christian
profession and the life of selfish sin and waste flashed into fierce
poetry in one such spirit of the last generation, who grew up in this
school.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Through the great, sinful streets of Naples, as
I passed,<br />
With fiercer heat than flamed above my head<br />
My heart was hot within me, till at last<br />
My brain was lightened when my tongue had said<br />
Christ is not risen.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And men who are truly in earnest about faith and life, and who are
perplexed and distressed by the contradictions and insincerities that
meet them, must often be moved as he was.</p>
<p>And yet, when we look closer, and consider that the battle of spiritual
progress has this peculiarity attached to it, that it has to be fought
over again, in every generation, and in every separate individual soul,
the result is less surprising.&nbsp; Remembering this, we do not expect
the victory of the last generation to save us from defeat or failure.</p>
<p><!-- page 111--><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>And this has to
be borne in mind equally in regard to the continuous life of societies
and to our own separate lives.&nbsp; Thus in such a society as this,
if our predecessors uplifted the standards of conduct, inculcated high
principles, and inspired their generation with a strong pervading spirit,
this should make it easier for us to do likewise; but it does not insure
our doing it.&nbsp; All this higher life will die in our hands if the
same regenerating spirit is not alive and working in our hearts also.&nbsp;
So, again, your individual victory over sin in the power of the Spirit
in you, does not save my life from having to fight the battle for itself
and win its own victories.</p>
<p>So that, however perplexing the phenomena of life may seem whilst
we look at them in the mass or from the outside, if we read the Gospel
of Christ as a message to our own souls a great deal of the perplexity
disappears.&nbsp; And it was with this personal message that Christ
came, and there is no hope of our understanding His mission, or of living
in the <!-- page 112--><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>light of His
transforming spirit, if we think of it in any other way than this.</p>
<p>The purpose of His revelation is to crucify the selfish instinct
in us, and to rouse us to the life of self-devotion, to the idea of
consecrated energies; and this being so, all Christian life is of the
nature of a warfare; and a warfare which begins afresh with each generation
of men; because selfishness, with all its tribe of attendant appetites
and passions, springs afresh in every single soul, and is nurtured,
strengthened, cultivated, by so many of the conditions of life.</p>
<p>If, then, the Spirit of Christ is really to prevail in our life,
it must be by effecting our emancipation from selfish instincts, and
rousing in us the spirit of devotion to the good of other lives.</p>
<p>In proportion as you diminish selfishness in your own life or in
any other, by fostering generous affections and cultivating the spirit
of social duty and religious aspiration, by walking in the footsteps
of Christ and living in the light of His presence, you are laying <!-- page 113--><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>the
only possible foundation of any lasting progress, you are following
the one true method by which the mystery of sin is to be overcome.</p>
<p>We may wonder that this should be so difficult; for of selfishness
we should say that we all dislike it.&nbsp; In its grosser forms we
repudiate it.&nbsp; The very word is one which we articulate with a
certain accent of contempt.</p>
<p>But when we come to its refined and subtle workings in our nature,
when we think of its Proteus-like changeableness, its power of assuming
the various guises even of duty or religion; when we reflect how it
can clothe itself in the choicest garb of art, or science, or divine
philosophy, we find very likely that we are always in danger of being
enslaved by it.</p>
<p>And we do well to pray in all sincerity that grace may expel our
selfishness; for indeed the influence of true religion is to be gauged
by the extent to which this prayer is being fulfilled in us.&nbsp; The
fulfilment of it is what we mean by the regenerate life.</p>
<p><!-- page 114--><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>I need not ask
you how you feel in the presence of any character which you recognise
as cleansed from all taint of selfishness, a character, softened, refined,
purified, inspired, consecrated.&nbsp; I would rather ask whether you
know of any personal influence to be compared with that of such a character.</p>
<p>And if, as I anticipate, you would answer that there is none like
it, I would ask you to bear in mind that this influence may be yours.&nbsp;
You are invited by all the highest calls within and around you to make
it yours.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the aim and purpose of his life?&rdquo;
is a question which men are justified in asking about us; and they are
justified in passing their verdict upon us by the answer which our life
gives.</p>
<p>Does he live for himself, they will ask, for his own pleasures, his
own delights, be they coarse or refined, his own indulgence, his own
particular interest?&nbsp; Is there anything of the spirit or enthusiasm
of sacrifice visible in the ordinary tenor of his actions?</p>
<p><!-- page 115--><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>The world, this
Christian world, is full of those concerning whom the answer to such
questions can only be a distinct negative; and yet we know that in all
such characters, whether in youth or age, Christianity is a failure.</p>
<p>Therefore we shall accept it as our primary duty, the purpose of
our existence as a Christian school, to train up men who shall be penetrated
by the spirit of unselfishness, possessed by the feeling that their
lives are to be consecrated to the common good.</p>
<p>Societies differ very widely in the type of character they impress.</p>
<p>Here and there we see a society, here and there a school, which has
somehow acquired the power to stamp on those who go out from it a certain
impress of nobility.</p>
<p>They go forth like the knights of our famous English legend&mdash;imperfect
no doubt and erring, but each one of them inspired with the consciousness
that his life is a holy quest.</p>
<p>There are other societies and schools among <!-- page 116--><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>them
which seem to possess everything but this one power.</p>
<p>What, then, are we to say of our hopes?&nbsp; What is to be the mission
of our generation here?&nbsp; Shall we contribute anything to raise
the common type?&nbsp; Or shall we drift on as the world drifts, a little
better, or a little worse?</p>
<p>Shall we not rather pray and hope as we begin once more to weave
the web of mutual influence, that you may grow up here not altogether
like the herd of common men, but emancipated early from the life of
selfish desire, feeling the spirit of Christ within you, remembering
your baptismal vows, with eyes open to heavenly visions, and not disobedient
unto them?</p>
<h2><!-- page 117--><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>XII.&nbsp; THE
SOWER AND THE SEED.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A sower went out to sow his seed.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St.
Luke </span>viii. 5.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is significant that the first of the Saviour&rsquo;s parables
is the parable of the sower, that the first thing to which He likens
His own work is that of the sower of seed, the first lesson He has to
impress upon us by any kind of comparison is that the word of God is
a seed sown in our hearts, a something which contains in it the germ
of a new life.</p>
<p>It is no less significant that He returns so often to this same kind
of comparison for the purpose of impressing us always with the primary
fact, that our relationship to God, the Father of Spirits, in other
words our spiritual condition at the present moment, our hope for the
time to come, does not depend upon some body of doctrine, but on <!-- page 118--><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>our
having received into the secret places of the heart the seeds of a new
life.</p>
<p>This is suggestive of a great many considerations which touch our
life very closely; but I will not turn aside to them at this moment,
as my desire is to fix your thoughts for the present on this one fundamental
thing, that the principle of moral and spiritual life in you is a seed,
and as such it is endowed with a power of independent separate growth;
it was intended to grow in you.</p>
<p>The sower casts his seed upon the earth and goes his way, and, once
sown, it springs up and grows, as Jesus said in another parable, &ldquo;he
knoweth not how.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, then, is the truth which He is impressing
on our attention, when He speaks of His revelation as a seed, a seed
to be sown by hands which have no control over it except to sow it.&nbsp;
The soul of each and every one of us is a seed-field, and the seeds
of new life and purpose should be growing in it.</p>
<p>As we recall the other parable of the seed growing secretly, recorded
in St. Mark&rsquo;s Gospel, we feel even more strongly how the essence
of <!-- page 119--><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>all our life is
in seeds of influence.&nbsp; &ldquo;So is the Kingdom of Heaven as if
a man should cast seed upon the earth, and the seed should spring up
and grow, he knoweth not how.&rdquo;&nbsp; It grows in us mysteriously
we know not how.</p>
<p>And I am not sure that we all, indeed I think it likely that we do
not all, take it home to our thoughts with sufficient seriousness that
this mysterious growth in the thing sown implies a mysterious vital
power or force which is inherent in it.</p>
<p>I call it a mysterious vital power, because all life is a mystery
to us.&nbsp; The very thought of life lands us in mystery, in mystery
which defies analysis.&nbsp; We know that all the life in us and around
us follows certain laws, as we call them, the life of plants, the life
of animals, the life of man, each following its own laws after its kind,
and that is all we know about it.&nbsp; We can observe its action, its
uniformities, its sequences, and variations, but beyond this we cannot
penetrate its secret.&nbsp; It grows mysteriously, we know not how.</p>
<p>But this much we know, that no life is spontaneously <!-- page 120--><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>generated.&nbsp;
The science of our day has demonstrated it, as we believe, beyond dispute,
that you cannot create life out of dead matter.&nbsp; All life comes
from some antecedent life.&nbsp; Wherever you see life of any kind,
you know that there must have been before it some form of life which
was its parent.</p>
<p>Yet again, the scientific investigator points out another suggestive
fact, that the lower creature does not of its own lower nature expand
into the higher, but that life is lifted up and grows by the infusion
of something higher than itself.&nbsp; So, too, we believe that the
Spirit of God touches with its mysterious power the dead souls of men;
it transforms them, it uplifts them, they are born again.&nbsp; They
are roused and stirred to new capacity by the touch and inspiration
of this Divine life.&nbsp; This is what is meant when it is said that
if any man be in Christ he is a new creature.&nbsp; He has received
into his nature this mysterious gift, or rather this seed of the new
life.</p>
<p>Such is the Christian doctrine of the new birth, or of the life-giving
breath of the Spirit, <!-- page 121--><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>or
of the sowing the seed of Divine life in us.&nbsp; You may describe
it how you please, if only you take due note of this, that in proportion
as you realise or accept this truth as in any way intimately connected
with your own personal life and conduct, all the common things around
you acquire a new importance, and I might even say some touch of sacredness,
because they are felt to be strewn with these seeds of influence which
God is sowing around us, with a hand that never rests, through all our
years, in uncounted ways.</p>
<p>This seed of new life which is to save you from the power of sin
and the flesh and give you new aspirations, purer tastes, stronger purposes,
need I remind you how it is sown, in what manifold and various ways?&nbsp;
It must be within the personal experience of some of you to testify
how your meetings in this chapel every morning may sow it.&nbsp; One
day it falls on your heart in some word of some hymn or prayer, or in
some thought or feeling which flashes through you, or some pricking
of conscience for no other knows what sin or fault, or in some new resolve.</p>
<p><!-- page 122--><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>Sometimes it is
found that a passing word of a preacher sows it (it is in this hope
I preach to you), or again it is sown in the common ways of daily life,
by the reading of some book, or by the word or example of a friend,
or by some casual sight or experience.&nbsp; We remember how the seed
of an unresting and beneficent life, a life devoted to the good of the
poor and the suffering, was sown in Lord Shaftesbury by the shocking
sight of a pauper funeral when he was a boy at Harrow.&nbsp; So it may
be sown in your hearts you know not beforehand when or where, to grow
up and bear fruit an hundred fold.</p>
<p>The wind bloweth where it listeth&mdash;so is every one that is born
of the Spirit.&nbsp; You never know what Divine seed it may deposit
in your heart at any moment; but this you do know, that if the word
of Christ be true, whenever this gift of life comes to you it is a new
birth.</p>
<p>And there is all the more mystery and sacredness about our common
life just because we never know how or when these seeds may <!-- page 123--><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>fall
upon our life to bless it, and because men are often altogether unconscious
of the beginnings of their growth in them.&nbsp; Some seed of good influence
falls into the soil of their heart, and seems to lie there buried in
the winter of neglect or waste.</p>
<p>Thus some men may carry the seeds long and far, not knowing the power
or the potency of the life that is in them; but some day they strike
root and grow and bear fruit in new convictions, or in new desires and
purposes; and this may be the case with any one amongst us, and hence
it is natural that we should press the question on ourselves and on
each other&mdash;What are you making of those seeds of higher life which
have been sown in you by your mother&rsquo;s love, by your father&rsquo;s
words, by all the lessons and influences of such a place as this, seeds
which are falling around you continually, and may possibly be trodden
down or overlaid?</p>
<p>As we look at these parables of the Lord telling of this sowing and
this growth of seeds, they bring it home to us very forcibly that <!-- page 124--><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>the
only true test of life in Christ is growth in Christian graces.&nbsp;
And this brings us to a consideration of grave practical importance.&nbsp;
It bids us be very careful to distinguish between seeds of life taking
root in the heart and springing up into new activities, and mere waves
of impression.&nbsp; The seed springs up and grows in you, the wave
merely flows over you, lifting and moving you for a moment, and then
leaving you as before.&nbsp; Thus, and it is a warning which is not
unneeded in our day, a day of much emotional religion, there is all
the difference in the world between a religion of moods and a religion
of growth.&nbsp; The one is the plaything of the winds, the other is
rooted in Christ.</p>
<p>Thus I am brought to two reflections, one on the function and aim
of the preacher, the other the duty of the hearer of God&rsquo;s word.&nbsp;
The preacher&mdash;and the same might be said of every master in such
a society as this&mdash;the preacher has to think of himself primarily
and chiefly as a servant of Christ charged with the duty of sowing the
seeds of spiritual <!-- page 125--><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>life
in your hearts.&nbsp; And the thought that the Saviour has revealed
to us seeds of life which have this regenerating power in them, and
that in Him we see what possibilities of growth there are in these seeds&mdash;this
is our constant encouragement.</p>
<p>The sower&rsquo;s hand may be feeble, and his sowing may be awkward,
or halting, or uncertain, but there is a Divine force or possibility
in all seeds of truth, or purity, or right feeling which he scatters
among you, independent of his sowing, and he never knows in what soul
some seed may lodge and germinate and grow up and bear fruit here and
hereafter, even to the endless life.</p>
<p>So we believe that every work of good influence, whether of man or
boy, will prosper, because we remember it as a part of God&rsquo;s providential
law, that His seed if sown grows of itself, mysteriously.&nbsp; And
we need not wonder at the mystery, for it is the Spirit of God which
is in the seed; and it is ready to swell and grow and bear new fruits
as it lodges in your heart.</p>
<p><!-- page 126--><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>Through and in
that seed of good influence it is God Himself who is working in you.</p>
<p>Such, as we learn from the word of Christ, such, as we see it exemplified
in His person, is the mystery of the Divine life in the hearts of men&mdash;not
in some other lives, but in your life and mine.</p>
<p>But this only leads us to another vital question&mdash;a question
which I leave with you for the present, and to which we may return another
day&mdash;What is your share of active duty in regard to these seeds
of good influence and good purpose that are sown in you; what are you
doing, and what are you intending to do, to secure that they shall be
bearing some fruit in your own daily life?</p>
<h2><!-- page 127--><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>XIII.&nbsp; THE
LENTEN FAST.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer.&rdquo;&mdash;S<span class="smcap">t</span>.
<span class="smcap">Mark </span>ix. 29.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You remember the narrative from which I have taken this verse.&nbsp;
Jesus, as we read, had just come down from the Mount of Transfiguration,
and when He was come to the multitude, a certain man besought him saying,
&ldquo;Have mercy on my son, for he is lunatic and sore vexed, and I
brought him to Thy disciples, but they could not cure him.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then Jesus rebuked the devil, and the child was cured from that hour.&nbsp;
Thereupon His disciples came to Him with this inquiry&mdash;&ldquo;Why
could not we cast him out?&nbsp; And He said to them, Because of your
little faith.&nbsp; This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer;&rdquo;
or, as our Authorised Version has it, &ldquo;by prayer and fasting.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 128--><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Here, then, we
have set before us a very striking and significant contrast: the contrast
between the spiritual power of Jesus fresh from the Mount of Transfiguration,
and the want of such power in His disciples, who represent to us the
common life of the multitude and the plain.&nbsp; His reply to their
question was clearly intended to suggest to them the cause of their
spiritual feebleness.&nbsp; Do you wonder at your lack of power over
the diseases of the soul?&nbsp; &ldquo;This kind can come forth by nothing,
but by prayer.&rdquo;&nbsp; Now, this suggestive answer is very appropriate
for our consideration at the present time when we are approaching the
season of Lent, which has been observed century after century as a special
season of fasting, prayer, and penitence for sin, through all the Christian
Church.</p>
<p>When we think of these weeks, it is reasonable to believe that such
observance, so universal, so long continued, must have satisfied some
deep need of the heart, especially as it is not based on any particular
dogma.&nbsp; And this incident in the Saviour&rsquo;s life, and these
emphatic <!-- page 129--><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>words of
His, may help us to a clearer understanding of the value of such times.&nbsp;
They declare to us the principle of the spiritual harvest, that, in
the spiritual life as in all else, we reap as we sow.&nbsp; They are
intended to convey to us this plain lesson, that if any of us give little
thought, attention, or effort to that side of our life which we speak
of as the spiritual, if there is in our daily habit and practice little
real prayer or self-denial, or devotion, little communing with God,
little endeavour to live in the spirit of Christ, and if, this being
so, we find ourselves weak or vacillating in our struggle against sin
or evil, whether in our own life or in society, there is nothing surprising
in such a result.</p>
<p>It is in our religious life just as in everything else&mdash;spiritual
carelessness or neglect must mean spiritual weakness.&nbsp; In all other
matters we look for results in some proportion to our efforts.&nbsp;
As we sow we expect to reap.</p>
<p>Here, for instance, in your daily life, if you wish to excel in any
particular game or pursuit, you practise it with diligence.&nbsp; You
<!-- page 130--><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>know that, without
such practice or concentration of effort upon it, any expectation of
excellence is simply foolish.</p>
<p>In your school work you recognise the same conditions.&nbsp; Intellectual
growth may seem sometimes to come slowly, in spite of all your efforts;
but it comes with certainty if you persevere, and it is equally certain
that it hardly ever comes at all to those who use no effort.</p>
<p>If, then, you look for progress or distinction, you know that you
must fix your thoughts upon your work, and practise industry, and, above
all, that you must cultivate a love of learning, so that your mind lingers
over it with some sense of enjoyment.</p>
<p>You do not expect a harvest where you have not sown.&nbsp; And it
is just this same law which you recognise and accept in other matters
that our Lord is here declaring to us as the law of spiritual power.</p>
<p>Do we desire to cast any evil influence or any weakness out of our
life?&nbsp; Do we ask despairingly how it is that we have not been <!-- page 131--><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>able
to cast it out?&nbsp; Our Lord&rsquo;s answer comes to us in these emphatic
words&mdash;&ldquo;This kind can come forth by nothing, but by prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In other words, if we really desire that our soul shall be cleansed
and strengthened, we must surrender it to Him in prayer and self-denial,
in spiritual exercises and communion, that He may cure it of its sin
or its weakness, and inspire us with new life.</p>
<p>Prayer and fasting are in this word of His the symbol of all special
exercises of the spirit, as it strives to get free from the burden of
the flesh and to come nearer to God; and without such exercises, He
presses it on us if we stand in need of such reminders, we cannot hope
for any harvest of spiritual strength.</p>
<p>And we can hardly have failed to notice how His own practice corresponds
with His warnings and injunctions.</p>
<p>Before He began His ministry we read of His forty days&rsquo; fast
in the wilderness; and at every turn, in the course of it, we read again
and again incidentally of His constant withdrawals into privacy with
God.</p>
<p><!-- page 132--><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>His short life
on earth was a life of spiritual ministry.&nbsp; All the common things
of life were to Him so many illustrations of some spiritual lesson of
the Father&rsquo;s love and care, or of man&rsquo;s dependence on Him.&nbsp;
In every voice of the world there was the undertone of some spiritual
suggestion.&nbsp; So that we might say&mdash;Surely His days were one
unbroken course of spiritual work and communion, and He could need no
special seasons or exercises; but His example teaches us a different
lesson.</p>
<p>As if to bring it home to us beyond all possibility of doubt or question,
that the most devoted, the most active, and most powerful spiritual
characters, will always be those whose communion with God in private
prayer and exercise is most constant and intense, He Himself was continually
withdrawing for such communion; and there are no more suggestive passages
in the Gospels for our guidance than those incidental references which
tell us, as if by chance, giving us passing glimpses into the unrecorded
portions of His life, how on one occasion He retired into a mountain
apart to <!-- page 133--><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>pray, or
how on another he spent the whole night apart in prayer, or how he was
in a desert place apart in prayer.</p>
<p>These withdrawals of Jesus into the solitude of the desert or the
mountain, these hours in which He was alone with the Father, are but
another name for those exercises of prayer, fasting, meditation, communion
with God, without which, as He tells His followers in the text I have
read to you, it is not possible to eradicate from the soul those influences
of sin which destroy its harmony and undermine its strength.</p>
<p>These withdrawals were His times of spiritual refreshment; and by
His practice He declares to us His need of them.&nbsp; And if in His
case they were necessary, much more are they necessary for you and me,
entangled as we are amidst all the varied influences of our common life,
and with natures prone to sin.</p>
<p>Hence it is that the Church has set apart this season of Lent to
come round to us year by year as a season of special thought and prayer
and self-denial.&nbsp; Many other times and seasons <!-- page 134--><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>come
to us laden with the same spiritual influences, and to be used by us
as times of reflection, inspiration, purification, and strengthening.&nbsp;
This is the purpose which the quiet of these recurring Sundays should
be fulfilling in our lives, or our gatherings for Holy Communion.</p>
<p>And once and again there comes to us in the course of life some time
or season which is sure to make its impression upon our soul as having
brought us in a special sense into the presence of God, and within the
overshadowing influences of His Spirit.</p>
<p>So it may happen to us that some family bereavement, the death of
father or mother, of brother or sister, or child of our affections,
draws us away from the world into a closer communion with our Father
in Heaven, a communion which is never entirely lost again or forgotten.&nbsp;
So, too, comes the season of confirmation, as to many of you just now,
with all its thoughts, feelings, prayers, and resolutions.</p>
<p>And it is a happy thing for our life when <!-- page 135--><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>any
of these seasons leave an indelible mark upon our memory and our spirit.</p>
<p>But as we think of these words of Jesus, &ldquo;This kind goeth not
out but by prayer and fasting&rdquo;&mdash;the question for each of
us here to-day is, what practical daily meaning we hope to give to this
season of Lent which is to begin on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Let us not fancy that we can allow such seasons to come and go, year
by year, giving them no thought or attention, without some corresponding
loss.</p>
<p>The voice of humanity, and the experience of centuries, the practice
of holy men, and the example and the words of Christ Himself, have all
testified to the need there is for the spiritual observance of such
times, if men are to keep their soul alive in them&mdash;and who are
we that we should venture to set ourselves against such overpowering
testimony?</p>
<p>Let us rather address ourselves seriously to making these weeks a
time of some special exercise or discipline such as our life may need.</p>
<p><!-- page 136--><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>There is hardly
one of us but will confess, if he thinks of the matter at all, that
the world is too much with us; that its influence is too strong upon
us; that we are too ready to conform to its ways and follow its indulgences.&nbsp;
And such a confession is equivalent to an acknowledgment that we need
these Lenten seasons.&nbsp; And if with this feeling in our hearts we
use the coming weeks with any definite purpose, praying to be rid of
some temptation or weakness, or to be endowed with some strength, or
to be supported in some good purpose, we are sure to recognise with
thankfulness, when the time is over, that it has indeed proved a time
of some dislodgment, that some temptation or habit has fallen away from
us and left us free, so that some new spirit or purpose has begun to
grow in us.</p>
<p>We shall, in fact, be conscious, as the weeks go on, that a new life
of new tastes and new satisfactions has sprung up, as the first fruits
of our prayer.&nbsp; If we doubt the need of such exhortations as these,
let us reflect for a <!-- page 137--><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>moment&mdash;Does
it not sometimes happen to us that our souls are only too like the soul
of that sick child in the Gospel?</p>
<p>Good instincts, and intentions, and tendencies, are clearly felt
and recognised, but they are fitful, weak, and intermittent.&nbsp; Another
spirit seems to lay hold of us and carry us whither it will.</p>
<p>If in any sense this can be said to be your case, then remember,
that just what the Saviour&rsquo;s healing word was to that child, sick
and possessed, as He met it on His way from the Hill of Transfiguration,
and breathed over it the spirit of the higher life, reducing the chaos
of the soul to harmony, and bringing reason out of madness, and freedom
out of demoniac possession, these holy seasons of time-honoured observance
may be to your soul, if you use them reverently, and as God&rsquo;s
appointed means for your growth in the Spirit.</p>
<h2><!-- page 138--><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>XIV.&nbsp; GOD&rsquo;S
CURSE ON SIN.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel,
every one according to his ways, saith the Lord God.&nbsp; Repent and
turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not
be your ruin.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ezekiel </span>xviii.
30.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words of Ezekiel may be understood as expressing in the prophet&rsquo;s
language what the Book of Deuteronomy expresses in such denunciations
as those which were read to us the other day in the Commination Service.</p>
<p>They correspond also to the warning of St. Paul when he says&mdash;&ldquo;Be
not deceived; God is not mocked; whatsoever a man soweth, that shall
he also reap.&nbsp; He that soweth to the flesh shall reap corruption;
and he that soweth to the spirit shall reap everlasting life.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Or again they correspond to that question which is put to us in the
Epistle to the Hebrews&mdash;&ldquo;If every transgression and disobedience
received <!-- page 139--><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>a just recompense
and reward, how shall we escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus we find in the Pentateuch, in Ezekiel, and in the apostolic
writings the representatives of three very different stages of religious
enlightenment, all teaching us in effect the same lesson, to remember
the recompense that sin never fails to bring upon him who commits it.&nbsp;
As we listen to the curses of Deuteronomy on one sin and on another,
and then read the language of Ezekiel or St. Paul, we are conscious
of a difference in the modes of thought and expression.&nbsp; The thought
of the apostle is separated from that of the lawgiver or the prophet
of the Old Testament by the new revelation and the sacrifice of Jesus;
but yet underneath all differences their judgment on every sinful act
or habit remains spiritually the same.&nbsp; They all alike bid us,
when we think of our sins, to think also of the inevitable punishment
which rises behind them like their shadow; and to bear in mind that
the root of the whole matter is the one incontrovertible and never-changing
fact of human life <!-- page 140--><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>that
as you sow you must expect to reap&mdash;he that soweth to the flesh
shall of the flesh reap corruption.</p>
<p>Now, inasmuch as your early years are the seed-time of your life,
these stern reminders that if you sow any sin in your soul you will
some day reap its curse, that God will judge you every one according
to his ways, all this is very appropriate for your consideration.&nbsp;
And you are likely to be all the more serious about your present life
and its habits, tastes, and purposes if this thought really takes possession
of you, that there is in fact a very close analogy between the life
of the soul and life around us in the outer world, and that every seed
we sow in it grows after its own kind.</p>
<p>In the region of animal or vegetable life you see and recognise this
law on every side.&nbsp; You trace it sometimes as the law of improvement
by culture, sometimes as the law of degeneration.</p>
<p>You cultivate and tend a garden or a field, sowing, planting, eradicating,
and the growths <!-- page 141--><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>of
flower or fruit improve in proportion to your care; but leave it to
itself and the weeds choke it, and the very fruit degenerates; your
rose becomes a dog-rose&mdash;it reverts, as men say, to a lower type.</p>
<p>So exactly is it with your own life; so long as it is grafted into
a life higher than your own, so long as good purposes are being sown
in it and good habits cultivated, and the bad weeded out and the Spirit
of God breathes through it, it is growing nearer to the Divine type;
but neglect it, or follow sinful impulse or low taste, and it becomes
like the garden of weeds; degeneracy begins at once, it is changing
to something worse, it is reverting to a lower type.</p>
<p>This is a way of expressing it which is sufficiently familiar to
you.&nbsp; But this is only our modern way of looking at those facts
of life which were eloquent to men of earlier times as the curse of
God.</p>
<p>As, then, it is undoubtedly true that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Our acts our angels are, for good or ill,<br />
Our fatal shadows that walk with us still,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><!-- page 142--><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>these stern warnings
which our Lenten services hold up before us are of the greatest value.</p>
<p>Keeping before us this law that in every region of life it is the
tendency of everything to bear fruit after its kind, we shall feel that
we can hardly impress it too deeply upon our minds that there is no
sin which we commit but will assuredly return upon our own heads.&nbsp;
The Israelites in the Old Testament saw the hand of God thus visiting
their sins upon them in many ways.&nbsp; They thought of Him as smiting
them for their sins with consumption or with fever, with plague or mildew,
or the sword of the oppressor.&nbsp; These are not our expectations.&nbsp;
We have learnt that it is not with such visitations that God punishes
us for our sinful indulgence or neglect, but that He does it with a
punishment which may be less obvious but is often more ruinous than
these.</p>
<p>Neglect the opportunities of good with which He strews your path
in early life, let some sin strike its roots in your heart and take
possession of it, and the curse of God <!-- page 143--><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>for
that neglect or that sin will overtake you, no doubt of it; coming not
perhaps as the Israelite on Mount Ebal expected it to come for any sin
of his, but coming, you hardly know how, as the change for the worse,
the sinking to lower levels of thought, and taste, and aim, and practice,
the reversion to lower types, which is the end of neglect, coming as
the creeping and insidious growth of the power of sin working ever stronger
in us as the natural fruit of indulgence.&nbsp; So the curse of that
ancient Jewish law turns out to be a terrible and unchanging truth,
written in a law which is never obsolete and grows not old, a law which
calls on us for our Amen! as it cries to us equally in the language
of Divine revelation and of the latest scientific discovery: &ldquo;Sow
neglect,&rdquo; it says, &ldquo;and you will reap deterioration; sow
sin, and you will reap corruption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This vision of the ultimate results of evil is a very ugly one, put
it in whatever shape you will, and we are naturally somewhat loth to
look it in the face.&nbsp; We would rather not <!-- page 144--><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>think
of any sin of ours as entailing such consequences.&nbsp; This conception
of Divine justice or retribution embodied in the action of unbending
laws and declaring that death is the fruit of sin, and that death must
come of it, this is no doubt a conception which inspires awe.&nbsp;
We shrink from it; we hardly dare to say Amen! to its dread utterances.&nbsp;
We should like, it may be, to shut our eyes to the fact and dwell rather
on the thought that our God is long-suffering and of great kindness
and of tender mercy.&nbsp; It is more soothing to think of love than
of retribution, or of the arm that shelters or upholds us than of the
hand that smites; but the real question should be&mdash;&ldquo;Is it
true, this declaration that as we sow we reap, that the wages of sin
is death, death of faculty, death of hope?&rdquo;&nbsp; It is foolish
to blink the sterner aspects of life.&nbsp; The fruit of such blinking
and turning aside is very often the very thing we do not like to think
of&mdash;indulgence and its retribution.&nbsp; Divine love and goodness
and long-suffering cannot occupy too much of our thoughts and prayers;
for it <!-- page 145--><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>is through
these that the heart is touched, and the spirit is fostered in us, and
we awake to the new life in Christ.</p>
<p>But if we shrink from contemplating that law of Divine retribution,
which works in men&rsquo;s lives side by side with the law of mercy
and love, it is time for us to ask ourselves&mdash;&ldquo;How is it
that I thus shrink from the thought of these penalties?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is indeed one sense in which we naturally shrink from the thought
that the wages of sin is death, even while we acknowledge that it is
so.&nbsp; It is inexpressibly sad to dwell on the infinite mass of sin
which is daily bearing its bitter and deadly fruit in the world, and
propagating itself after its kind; to think of the untold number of
darkened or misguided souls that have sown to the flesh, and are going
in consequence down to failure and death, blighted, corrupted, ruined.&nbsp;
From this thought we naturally turn to the thought of God&rsquo;s mercy,
and pray that He may yet sow the seeds of new hope in the dismal waste
of such lives.</p>
<p><!-- page 146--><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>But it happens
to us, I fear sometimes, that this thought of God&rsquo;s curse on sin
sends a chill through the heart, and we shrink away from it, because
of our own unregenerate life, because of the fascination which sinful
impulse or habit exercises over us.</p>
<p>If the warning voice of our Lenten Commination Service has convicted
any one of us of this motive for shrinking from its stern sentence,
it has come to us as a true messenger of the God who has no pleasure
in the death of him that dieth.&nbsp; We need the voice of these threatenings,
because the heart has such a great power of self-deception in it.&nbsp;
Men find it so easy to thrust away into the dim background of their
thoughts all the dark but sure consequences of present sins, treating
them as a debt which will come up no doubt for payment some day, but
may be put aside just now.</p>
<p>And one virtue of our stern plain-speaking Lenten services is this,
that they will not allow us to forget that fated reckoning day&mdash;they
put us, whether we like it or not, face to <!-- page 147--><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>face
with the sure consequences of sin; and they compel us to listen to the
question&mdash;&ldquo;What is the choice of thy life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For you will bear in mind that we read all these decrees of Divine
law with our eye fixed on our own life and not on our neighbour.&nbsp;
They are meant to help us to judge ourselves, and not some other person;
they lead us to penitence and not to criticism, so that our readiness
or our unwillingness to meet and to weigh them, and to respond to them
with definite prayer and penitence, may be taken as an index of our
religious sincerity, and of our readiness to consecrate our lives to
the service of our Saviour Christ.</p>
<p>And it is well for us that we should ask ourselves these questions;
for if indeed it is true that every transgression and disobedience shall
receive its just recompense and reward, how else shall we escape?</p>
<h2><!-- page 148--><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>XV.&nbsp; THE
CONFLICT WITH EVIL.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us
from evil.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Matthew </span>vi. 13.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is good for us sometimes to stand still for a moment and consider
our use of very familiar words.&nbsp; And this petition may appropriately
illustrate our need of such an exercise.</p>
<p>It is on your lips every day.&nbsp; Every Sunday you offer it you
hardly know how many times, in private and in public prayer: &ldquo;Lead
us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the
moment you stop to think about it you feel&mdash;who does not?&mdash;that
it is a very solemn and moving petition if you offer it before God in
sincerity, and with an honest desire to be kept out of the way of sin;
but it becomes a fearful mockery if it is offered <!-- page 149--><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>with
unclean lips, or by one who is living in any sort of sinful practice,
either secret or open.</p>
<p>And yet, as we all know, it is possible to do this, making the prayer
mere lip service, under the influence of daily custom.&nbsp; This, then,
is the question it suggests to us whenever we stop to think about it:
How far are we endeavouring to keep our lives in accordance with the
spirit of such a petition?&nbsp; &ldquo;Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.&rdquo;&nbsp; Most of you, I can well believe,
would not voluntarily or deliberately step out of your way to meet a
temptation, or to seek any evil course of life.&nbsp; You would not
do it of your own free choice, or in cold blood, as we say.&nbsp; This,
at any rate, is your own feeling about sin, whether the feeling is consistent
with your life or not.&nbsp; As you contemplate any low form of life
in another, you recognise its ugliness and its degrading character,
and you call it very likely by the name it deserves.&nbsp; If, then,
you find yourself <!-- page 150--><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>involved
in any sin, in spite of these feelings, and although you take this daily
prayer upon your lips, how comes it to be so?&nbsp; How comes it that
you remain in this pitiable condition?</p>
<p>Your answer is, perhaps, that temptation comes upon you unawares,
and that it takes you by surprise; or it seems to watch for some moment
of forgetfulness or weakness; or you fight against a temptation, but
still it clings to you as if it had a life of its own and were independent
of you; or you are drawn into sin you scarcely know how; or you are
driven into it by some one whom you fear although you despise him; or
it seems to you to be in the very air you breathe.&nbsp; And although
such answers explanatory of a life of sin or waste are no real excuse
for it, they are very often quite true.&nbsp; If it were not so, the
devil would not be the dangerous enemy that he assuredly is to our spiritual
life; our risk of failure in our battle with sin would not be so <!-- page 151--><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>great
as experience shows it to be.&nbsp; We must therefore expect that temptations
to sin will sometimes come upon us quite by surprise and at unlocked
for moments, and that some temptations will linger and cling to us with
a hateful persistence; you must be prepared also to find that some companion
may draw you towards a sin, or a bully may endeavour to drive you into
it.&nbsp; Your life is a happy one if it is free from all such risks,
but you cannot count upon such freedom.&nbsp; So that, if any one begins
his life thinking that his conflict with evil and its manifold temptations
is going to be an easy one, he begins under a dangerous delusion, and
he is likely to end in some disastrous failure.</p>
<p>You desire, let us hope, to keep your soul unstained by evil ways.&nbsp;
If, then, you remember that to secure such a stainless and unpolluted
life you have not only to fight with some external enemy now and then,
but against dark and insidious powers of evil which seem to start up
around <!-- page 152--><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>you and in
the very citadel of your heart unawares, and that except through a constant
sense of God&rsquo;s presence in your life you cannot hope to keep free
from their influence, this feeling should give reality and earnestness
to our daily prayer to be delivered from the evil.</p>
<p>And, indeed, this feeling that our life is set in the midst of many
and great dangers is one of the first requisites for its moral safety.&nbsp;
It stands beside us with its warning, whenever a temptation to some
sin besets us, reminding us that, no matter how pleasant or attractive
the temptation may seem to be, or how trifling the sin that it suggests,
it is in fact an outpost of a great army, whose name is legion, and
that we should hold no parleyings and have no dealings with it, for
it breathes corruption, and it brings degradation and death behind it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Obsta principiis</i>&rdquo; may indeed be said to be a
warning specially needed by us in regard to every kind of temptation.&nbsp;
But <!-- page 153--><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>we may go further
than this.&nbsp; Our safety from particular sins depends very often
and very largely, at a critical moment, upon our general attitude and
feeling towards sin in every shape.</p>
<p>It must be acknowledged, I think, that most sins which lay their
hold upon us and master us, or struggle long and hard for the mastery,
make their first entrance into the soul so easily, because they find
it swept and garnished for their reception, and its doors wide open.&nbsp;
With reference to this you have only to reflect on some chapter of your
own experience.&nbsp; Has it never happened that, when some wrong or
sinful act or thought or speech was first presented to you, it stirred
a feeling of shrinking, or strong dislike, or fear, or uneasiness, or,
it may be, disgust; but instead of listening to that warning voice,
and spurning the temptation utterly, as your feeling bade you do, you
were attracted somehow to turn and gaze upon it.&nbsp; You knew it to
be sin, but you felt <!-- page 154--><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>no
repulsion.&nbsp; Your soul was not garrisoned and defended by any strong
sense of the hatefulness and deadly influence of all sin as such; so
if you fled from it it was with a backward look; and then you allowed
yourself to think of it in others, or you lived on friendly and familiar
terms with those who were stained by it; possibly you even jested about
it; you let your thoughts feed upon it; you expressed no stern disapproval
of it; you allowed the atmosphere of your life to be tainted by it;
and at last your adversary the devil, having rejoiced to see his wiles
thus gathering round you, saw you slip or plunge into the sin, and go
one great step nearer to becoming his bondslave&mdash;just as some foolish
bird, fluttering this way and that instead of spreading its wings for
a heavenward flight into the pure and safe upper air, might plunge into
the snares of the fowler.&nbsp; And yet all the while, although you
were living this weak and vacillating life, which is the seed-field
of <!-- page 155--><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>sin, you were
praying to God every day&mdash;&ldquo;Lead us not into temptation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If we remember any such experience we may at least gather from it
some lessons of safety and strength for the time to come.&nbsp; It reminds
us first of all how vitally important is our general attitude towards
every form of sin and its allurements.&nbsp; On this attitude it very
often depends whether your life is to be comparatively free from pitfalls,
or whether it is to be beset with dangers at every turning.&nbsp; If
by your attitude and behaviour you cause it to be felt that sin is hateful
to you, and that you are sincere when you pray that God may keep you
from all evil, a great many of the temptations that would otherwise
make your life difficult and dangerous will shrink away abashed; or
if the tempter ventures to assail you, he will do it half-heartedly
when he sees that you repel him with a whole-hearted repugnance.&nbsp;
It is this attitude even more than individual acts which fixes the tone
of a society.</p>
<p><!-- page 156--><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>When there is
no prevalent sense that there are those present who maintain this attitude
of hatred and contempt for sin and everything that breeds or fosters
it, the tone, as men say, becomes low, or lax, the air becomes corrupt,
and life in such surroundings becomes full of peril.&nbsp; If the good
are timid, shrinking, showing no positive fervour, no zeal for virtue,
and no moral indignation against evil influence, then the bad in their
society will lift up their heads and walk boldly.&nbsp; But when, on
the other hand, they who are in their hearts convinced of the sinfulness
of sin, and of the infinite mischief that may arise out of any form
of it, are not ashamed to show it by their attitude, they cause the
base to hide itself in its proper darkness, and they create an atmosphere
around them in which temptations lose a great deal of their force and
strength.</p>
<p>Let this, then, be your feeling about your life&mdash;that when it
is assailed by any sin, that sin is not something isolated or <!-- page 157--><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>insignificant;
it is not something which may be indulged or accepted, as if it had
no relation with other sins; it is a part of an infinite brood of evil;
and that if you admit it within the circle of your life, or tolerate
it in the air you breathe, you never know where its pestilent germs
may fall, and breed, and multiply, and what mischief may come of it.</p>
<p>It is this feeling of the mysterious vitality of sin, and the subtle
kinship of one form of sin with other forms, and its destructiveness
when it seizes on a life or poisons an atmosphere, that helps us more
than anything else to feel the force and the intensity of the Saviour&rsquo;s
prayer for us: &ldquo;Holy Father, keep through Thine own name those
whom Thou hast given Me.&nbsp; I pray not that Thou shouldest take them
out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from evil.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It is this same feeling of the spreading, insidious, infectious and
destructive nature of sin that makes us echo this as our first and most
<!-- page 158--><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>earnest prayer for
all we love, that God may keep them from evil; and it is this that makes
us value so highly and recognise with thankful hearts every example
of a pure and strong life, which gives inspiration and strength to those
around it.</p>
<h2><!-- page 159--><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>XVI.&nbsp; SPIRITUAL
BLINDNESS.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As it is written, God hath given them the spirit
of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should
not hear.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Romans </span>xi. 8.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blindness in part is happened to Israel.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Romans
</span>xi. 25.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a sad and painful reflection, and one which is continually
forced upon us as we read the New Testament, that the long training
and preparation of the Jews brought them at the last not to the acceptance
but to the rejection of Jesus.</p>
<p>They had been taught, generation after generation, that they were
the called and chosen people of God.&nbsp; Psalmists and prophets had
enriched their life with the outpouring of their moral and spiritual
revelations, and fired their hopes with promises.&nbsp; They lived in
the expectation of the Messiah who was to complete these revelations
of the God <!-- page 160--><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>who had
led them and taught them ever since the days of their Egyptian bondage.</p>
<p>Yet, when this crowning revelation came to them, they could not even
recognise it.&nbsp; The Son of God &ldquo;came unto His own and His
own received Him not.&rdquo;&nbsp; As St. Paul expresses it in my text,
while grieving for them with all the intensity of his fervid affection,
their life was overgrown with a sort of spiritual dulness.&nbsp; They
were suffering from a sort of ossification of the spirit, so that the
last and greatest revelation of God could make no impression upon them.</p>
<p>But this picture of the Jews rejecting and crucifying their Saviour,
and unable to appreciate or to receive the gift of new life which was
offered to them, blind to its beauty, unattracted by its charm, is not
only one of the saddest sights in history, it is very instructive for
every one of us, because it is charged with warnings that are never
out of date.&nbsp; For there is no individual life, and no society,
that is not liable to drift into a similar dulness of vision, <!-- page 161--><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>and
so to reject or disregard what God gives for its enlightenment.&nbsp;
The great critical events in the world&rsquo;s history, the events that
make epochs in the consciousness of men, are not different in kind from
those of our own obscure lives.&nbsp; They are, as it were, our own
familiar experience, written prophetically and written large.</p>
<p>So the blindness that happened to Israel, and arrested their spiritual
growth, may be happening no less to any of us.&nbsp; As God gave them
the spirit of slumber, so it may be with our lives.</p>
<p>And the very thought of our possible risks in this respect is valuable
to us.</p>
<p>To be conscious that in regard to any of the higher and better things
of life our eyes may possibly be growing dim, and our ears dull of hearing,
and that God may be pressing upon us gifts of great price which we are
too dull to see or to accept&mdash;if our soul is sufficiently awake
to feel this, then the very feeling may of itself be the germ of new
life in us.</p>
<p><!-- page 162--><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>And it is very
certain, on the other hand, that if we are altogether without any such
feelings there is a risk, which even amounts to a probability, that
the hardening or deadening influences of custom and tradition will sooner
or later degrade our life.&nbsp; And if it should be asked,&mdash;How
comes it that we are so liable to be affected by this dulness of spirit
and of general habit?&mdash;we have to reply that it is because of the
sensitiveness of the human soul to surrounding influences.</p>
<p>It is because our souls are so receptive, so imitative, and in consequence
so easily perverted, darkened, blinded, or misled.&nbsp; I suppose we
are all of us conscious of this sensitiveness of the moral and spiritual
nature; we should all say, if questioned, that we are quite aware of
it, and that no one would dispute it.&nbsp; The soul of every child
or man, we should say, is a fine and delicate and sensitive instrument,
with the possibilities in it of we know not what Divine harmonies, but
easily spoilt.</p>
<p><!-- page 163--><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>And yet, when
we look at all the common and traditional ordering of daily life, whether
in our educating of the young or in the influences that we allow to
prevail among young and old, it would seem sometimes as if this thought
of the soul&rsquo;s sensitiveness had never dawned upon us.&nbsp; When
we once really grasp this thought, or, let us rather say, when this
thought has once really fastened upon our mind, and fixed itself there,
so that it remains with us, and goes about with us; and when, in consequence,
we come to feel how easily any soul may be perverted, or rendered hard
or dull; in one word, how easily it may be degraded; then it follows
that we look with new eyes on many things, many customs, many influences
which the unthinking hardly notice, or notice only to misjudge.</p>
<p>In the light of this feeling of the soul&rsquo;s sensitiveness, the
thoughtful man is very often intolerant of things which to others seem
of little moment, because he sees how they are tending to dull or deaden
the eye <!-- page 164--><span class="pagenum">p. 164</span>of the soul,
or to pervert or to kill its finer instincts; and how, in consequence,
though tradition may have given them a sort of spurious consecration,
or the world in its blindness may have come to honour them, they are
in fact laden with mischief to the general life.</p>
<p>It was the thought of this sensitiveness of the soul to external
influences, and of the ease with which any bad influence, or bad custom
or practice or fashion, perverts common lives, and of the untold mischief
which is consequently latent in it, that winged the words of a well-known
writer when she protested, some years ago, against what she designated
as debasing the moral currency.</p>
<p>That writer was thinking primarily of vulgar jesting on great subjects,
which should stir us to admiration and reverence, and so debasing men&rsquo;s
tastes.&nbsp; She had in her mind the class of persons who have the
art of spoiling things that are noble or beautiful by their vulgar handling
of them; and of the mischief which is done by such persons to public
taste and tone and character.</p>
<p><!-- page 165--><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>But we may widen
the reference.&nbsp; Whosoever, in anything that concerns the conduct
of life, spreads low notions, or drags down men&rsquo;s opinion or taste,
thus helping to pervert ordinary minds from those higher aims and motives
and those reverent views of character and life which should be cherished
for our common use and service, is debasing the moral currency.</p>
<p>Here, then, we have a very practical question for our consideration
and answering.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there anything in my life&rdquo;&mdash;so
the question comes to us in our self-examination&mdash;&ldquo;which
could be so described? any influence, spreading from my conduct, of
which men might truly say that it also is helping to debase the moral
currency?&nbsp; Is there to be seen in it anything that tends towards
the lowering of common standards? any misuse of things sacred or holy?
any foolish or vulgar estimate of the higher things of life?&rdquo;&nbsp;
And if we are in any doubt how to put these questions in a concrete
and practical shape, we have only to remember how <!-- page 166--><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>any
one who helps to lower any standard of taste or conduct is debasing
the moral currency of life; how, for instance, all those are debasing
it who substitute any wrong notion of honour for right notions of honour,
or who put roughness and coarseness in place of manliness, or who set
the fashion of cynical judgments on good and bad characters.</p>
<p>Or we might take an illustration from what is, unhappily, a very
common element in English life: the habit of gambling sport.&nbsp; Wherever
this habit spreads, in any class of society, from the highest to the
lowest, its effect is invariable; it undermines integrity, it hardens
the heart and debases taste, and is the willing handmaid of other vices.&nbsp;
Moral degradation is its inseparable companion.&nbsp; Therefore, if
you mix in it, or share in it, or give any adhesion or countenance to
it, which helps, as men say, to make it respectable, and so to spread
its influence, you are debasing the moral currency.</p>
<p>Or take another common case.&nbsp; You are familiar with the poet&rsquo;s
description, &ldquo;And thus <!-- page 167--><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>he
bore without abuse the grand old name of gentleman.&rdquo;&nbsp; That
is a noble thing for any man or boy to have said of him; and there is
not one among you who does not desire always to be able to claim that
name as his own.</p>
<p>But, wherever we go in the world, how many men there are who claim
it and yet debase it by ignoble use!&nbsp; They help to spread the notion
that a man may be a man of low morality and still a gentleman; that
his gentlemanliness may be a mere varnish of culture and manners, a
thin veneering having underneath it only meanness, or coarseness, or
corruption; and that, notwithstanding this, he may still claim to be
called a gentleman.&nbsp; Those who spread such doctrines are debasing
the moral currency of English life.&nbsp; And it should be the mission
of schools like this, and of those who grow up in them, to pour upon
all such persons the contempt which they deserve, and to restore the
currency of common life to something of Christian purity.</p>
<p><!-- page 168--><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>Remembering, then,
how sensitive the soul is, and how easily by example, or conduct, or
fashion it may be so perverted as to lose its clear vision and higher
aims, its pure tastes and ennobling emotions, we have to make it our
ambition and endeavour that our life may be kept free from such debasement.</p>
<p>But, if we are to succeed in this, we must make it our daily prayer
that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ will enlighten the eyes of our
understanding, and give unto us the spirit of wisdom and revelation
in the knowledge and love of Him.</p>
<h2><!-- page 169--><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>XVII.&nbsp; A
NEW HEART.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit
will I put within you.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ezekiel </span>xxxvi.
26.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the beautiful and suggestive dream of Solomon, which is recorded
in the third chapter of the First Book of Kings, God appears to him,
saying, &ldquo;Ask what I shall give thee&rdquo;; and Solomon&rsquo;s
answer is, &ldquo;O Lord, I am but a child set over this great people,
give me, I pray Thee, a hearing heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; And God said to
him, &ldquo;Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for
thyself long life, nor riches; behold, I have done according to thy
words.&nbsp; I have given thee a wise and understanding heart, and I
have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches and
honour.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the record of this vision was clearly meant
to indicate that the supreme gift of the wisest of men was the <!-- page 170--><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>hearing
or understanding heart.&nbsp; On the other hand, there is nothing against
which our Lord in the Gospels utters stronger warnings than that dulness
or deadness of spirit which is described as having eyes that see not,
and ears that are dull of hearing, and hearts that do not understand.&nbsp;
And in illustration of this we read how, while the crowds throng or
press upon Jesus, it is the stricken woman who, with soul sensitive
to His influence, feels the virtue come out of Him though she only touches
the hem of His garment.</p>
<p>Thus we are warned to beware lest that should come upon us which
was the ruin of the Jews, dulness or deadness of spiritual faculty;
and we are exhorted to pray for and to cherish the hearing heart, the
soul that sees and feels spiritual influences, and is sensitive to every
high call.&nbsp; And if your soul is thus open and receptive, it is
marvellous how full the world becomes to you of Divine voices.&nbsp;
They come upon you unexpected, unsought, sending through your heart
some illuminating flash of surprise, so that you wonder at your previous
<!-- page 171--><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>dulness; they strike
you with the sudden shock of some new knowledge or insight, and make
you feel, as never before, the true nature of your daily conduct or
your duty and your relation to other men; or they come as the unresting
presence of some new thought, which, once roused, haunts and troubles
you with questions which you cannot answer, or feelings which you cannot
get rid of.</p>
<p>When the soul is roused in this way we see and feel the hatefulness
of any sin that may have tempted or beset us; or we contrast our own
life with that of those whose lot is so much harder than ours, and we
are struck with shame at our selfishness, or waste, or our indifference
to the privation, and sin, and suffering that are all around us in the
world.</p>
<p>Or sometimes these Divine voices in our ears bring it home to us
how much we are losing out of our life&rsquo;s higher possibilities,
if from sinful or selfish habit, from dulness of spirit or lack of sympathy,
we cut ourselves off in thought and feeling and interest from the great
<!-- page 172--><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>needs, the great
sorrows, the great pulsations of the larger world.</p>
<p>But why, you may ask, do I dwell on all this?&nbsp; It is because
these are the true Advent voices for us, coming as they do to rouse
us out of narrow preoccupation, to open our eyes to the sinfulness of
sin, to make us feel that the self-centred, isolated, self-seeking life
is a life of a low type, and to stir us with social and religious interests
and enthusiasms.</p>
<p>These calls that come to you, whether invited or not, and that stir
your heart, speaking to you out of the multitudinous life of the time
you live in, are like the watchmen on the walls of Jerusalem, which
never hold their peace day nor night.</p>
<p>This ferment of higher life within us and around us, these voices
of the Spirit in us, as it struggles to lift us out of the region of
fleshly influences, is renewed in every generation and in every single
life.&nbsp; If you hear no such voices, if the phenomena of life make
no such impression upon you, if you are deaf to all these calls, and
care for none of these <!-- page 173--><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>things,
then it is clear that your soul is not yet awake in you; you are living
with a dull or darkened heart.&nbsp; It is a sort of cave life, or subterranean
life, you lead in such a case, a life of lower rank and lesser hopes.</p>
<p>Yet these voices from above, that come as the witness of the Divine
Spirit with our spirit that we are the children of God, never fail us.&nbsp;
They do not belong only to times far off.&nbsp; We are not to think
of them merely as enshrined in the Bible and peculiar to it; but as
living voices that are speaking to us to-day out of the depths of the
Divine life, in which our life is sustained.</p>
<p>But we have always to bear this in mind, that the Divine voices speak
to men with most stirring effect in every generation when they speak
to them through the pressing needs of their own day.&nbsp; To the Jews
the voice of God came in the inspired language of their deliverers and
prophets&mdash;in their unceasing warnings, and their impassioned appeals,
and their revelations of new truth.&nbsp; To the first generation of
Christians these same voices <!-- page 174--><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>came
in the shape of strong Advent hopes.&nbsp; Many things contributed to
lift the Apostles and their followers nearer to God than men of ordinary
times.&nbsp; They had seen the Lord; they had lived in His presence;
they had gone through much tribulation; the tongue of fire had rested
on them; the Spirit had taken full possession of them; but we cannot
read the New Testament without feeling that the most stirring, the most
regenerative influence in their society was the vividness and intensity
of their Advent hope.&nbsp; Their expectation of the Lord&rsquo;s return
lifted them out of the temptations of the world and above the trials
of it.&nbsp; It took hold of their active powers, and made them new
men.</p>
<p>Their Advent expectation was not the vague, half mystic, half sentimental
movement of the heart, which just touches the lives of so many Christians
during our Advent seasons, while it does not really alter any of their
earthly concerns.</p>
<p>Christ was very near to the Apostolic Christians.&nbsp; As the eastern
sky brightened <!-- page 175--><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>every
morning they felt that it might be the light of His coming; they thought
of Him as only hidden from them by the neighbouring cloud.&nbsp; They
looked for Him to return at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in
the noonday, and none could say how soon.&nbsp; And so it came to pass
that this expectation made those first believers, those humble followers
of Christ, those Galilean fishermen, those obscure provincials, instinct
with that great life which lifts men above the world, and constitutes
them a new power in it.</p>
<p>Our lives are largely influenced by the thought of slow development;
but we miss a great deal of the secret of all higher life if we forget
this wonderful exaltation of the poor and ignorant and obscure by this
gift of the Spirit and the inspiration of Divine hope.&nbsp; It was
not by any method which we could have forecast that those men found
out this charm which takes the heart captive and regenerates the life.&nbsp;
In their presence we feel the force of the prophet&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;Not
by might nor by power, but by My spirit, saith the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 176--><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>But then there
rises the question, How are these Divine influences to become powerful
in us also?</p>
<p>On the one hand, we are conscious that as we live involved or entangled
in the worldly life, or in any form of external life around us, the
spiritual part of us slumbers or is overlaid.&nbsp; It loses its practical
power over our thought, our feeling, and our conduct&mdash;our lamp
goes out.&nbsp; Whilst on the other hand we are conscious that the special
form of Advent expectation which inspired and possessed the first generation
of Christians is gone from us past recovery.&nbsp; We see clearly enough
as we read the New Testament what that first generation expected, and
how the expectation transformed their lives; but we see also that they
were mistaken in their hope, and that God&rsquo;s providential plan
proved to be far greater than their human conception of it.&nbsp; What,
then, are our Advent hopes?</p>
<p>There are two things which we should keep clear in our minds concerning
them.&nbsp; One, that they must be based upon our feeling of the <!-- page 177--><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>living
influence of Christ and the working of the Holy Spirit; and the other
is that the voices of the Spirit must come to us out of the needs of
our own life and of the time we live in if they are to lead us to practical
issues.&nbsp; When we look out upon the world and its life we feel that
Advent hopes must take some new form if they are to preserve reality
and to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>We see decaying faith in some quarters, and selfishness growing where
faith decays; we see ignorance and want and all their crop of sin and
misery deep-rooted in the life of every city; and the prospect which
these things suggest, the problems that meet us as we think of them,
might well fill us with misgiving.&nbsp; And they would indeed do so
were it not for the fact that the revelation of such things brings with
it another revelation also; it seizes on men&rsquo;s souls and stirs
them as with a Divine summons.&nbsp; And thus we have these hopeful
signs for the future rising around us, even where things look darkest,
that the great problems of humanity are felt in our day to <!-- page 178--><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>be
above all things its social and religious problems.&nbsp; And seeing
that the aspirations of the time&mdash;the feelings, the purposes, the
aims, and hopes that lift men&mdash;grow out of the needs of the time
and the problems of its life, we look forward&mdash;we have good ground
for looking forward&mdash;to a generation of men who shall be distinguished
by religious earnestness and by social enthusiasm.</p>
<p>But if this be so, what will your share be in this coming life?&nbsp;
The Spirit of God, as we now understand it, comes to us with calls of
this kind.</p>
<p>If you would hasten the Advent of Christ in your own soul and in
the souls of others, you must discard selfishness, you must rise above
self-indulgence, you must prepare to merge yourself in the social life,
for the social good; seeing that the growth of this good is the only
sure and certain sign of the coming of the Lord.&nbsp; So, then, the
Angel of the Advent is thus calling us.&nbsp; The future before you
is big with social and religious issues, and the Spirit of Christ is
brooding over it, and you and such as you are to be His chosen instruments
in helping forward these issues.</p>

SPIRITUAL POWER.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And behold I send <i>the promise of My Father
upon you</i>; but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be <i>endued
with power from on high</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;<span class="smcap">St. Luke
</span>xxiv. 49.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye shall receive <i>power</i>, after that the Holy Ghost is

</blockquote>
<p>To-day we are celebrating the last of the series of historical festivals
which mark the springtime of our Christian year.&nbsp; And without this
one the rest would leave us with a sense of incompleteness; for we should
be without its gift of the abiding and indwelling Spirit, and the fulfilment
of the last promise.</p>
<p>What, then, are we learning of its practical lessons, and gathering
into our life?&nbsp; We have read the Pentecostal narrative, and others
that illustrate it.&nbsp; We have sung Pentecostal hymns.&nbsp; We have
joined in special prayer for the light of the Holy <!-- page 180--><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>Spirit
to shine in our hearts, giving us a right judgment; and if we are led
to ask, &ldquo;To what purpose is all this?&rdquo; the answer is to
be seen in the texts I have just read to you, the burden of which is
the gift of power from on high.&nbsp; Do we not recognise this as the
end of the New Testament revelation?&nbsp; And do we not acknowledge
that this revelation fails, so far as we are concerned, if it gives
us no such <i>power</i>?&nbsp; It is, indeed, in considering this power
of the Spirit that we touch to the quick the real influence of religion
in the practical life of men; for experience shows that it is possible
for a man to be endowed with almost every other gift and yet to lack
this one&mdash;this indwelling gift of the Holy Ghost the Comforter.</p>
<p>Our life is filled with almost everything we could ask or require
to enlighten us or to guide and direct, and yet it fails sometimes.</p>
<p>It may be failing in some of us here to-day, just from want of this
Divine spark, <!-- page 181--><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>this
influence of a Spirit from above taking up His abode in us, burning
and shining in our hearts so as to purge our affections from sinful
taint and purify our tastes, lifting up and enlarging our capacities,
and rousing our energies&mdash;in one word, fusing all our life into
a new form with its refining power.</p>
<p>And the question of all questions for each of us to consider is,
&ldquo;How am I to make my life the home and embodiment of this power
from above?&rdquo;&nbsp; If we turn to our Lord&rsquo;s own example,
or to the life of Paul or any other of His followers, or to any life
we have known and felt to breathe around it this same power of the Spirit,
some things become at once very obvious and clear to us.</p>
<p>That supreme example and those lives declare that whoever desires
to have his soul purified and invigorated, to be charged with this Divine
electric influence, must have something of separateness and independence
in his life; he must feel himself <!-- page 182--><span class="pagenum">p. 182</span>as
not merely one of a crowd moved by the desires, aims, hopes, tastes,
and ambitions which may chance to prevail around him, but as a separate
soul in direct communion with the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>But if we are to realise this in our own life, it means that our
times of daily prayer, whether in private or in public, are times at
which we lay open our secret life to the Divine presence and influence;
it means that we give some real thought and meditation to this presence
of God in our life, and that we thus feed our souls continually on wholesome
spiritual food.&nbsp; It is in this way that men&rsquo;s lives become
in a real sense the temples of the Holy Spirit, and the influences of
sin fall away from them.</p>
<p>But the hindrances that are always acting to undermine or destroy
any such spiritual power in us are manifold, and seldom far away from
our life.</p>
<p>The world outside is always with us and acting in this way, distracting
thought, <!-- page 183--><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>setting
up its own standards, drawing us into its channels, and deadening the
Spirit in us.&nbsp; This is one of the inevitable conditions of life
as you will have to live it, and the man who is in earnest recognises
it as a paramount reason why he should never drop out of his personal
practice the habit of separate prayer and communion with God.&nbsp;
Or again, we may, and often do, let these hindrances grow up within
us through our own fault, and quite apart from any active influences
of the outer world.</p>
<p>We contract a dulness of spirit, so that spiritual things have no
interest and faith has no living power in the heart; and all this very
often not because any person, or anything outside of us, can be said
to have led us away and entangled us, but simply because we have taken
no pains to keep our life within the range of spiritual influences;
we have let prayer slip out of it; we have lived in no spiritual companionship;
we have done nothing to <!-- page 184--><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>keep
our soul alive in us.&nbsp; This is how men choose the lower life, and
surrender their birthright out of pure inertia, so that they lose their
spiritual capacity.</p>
<p>But worst of all hindrances to the indwelling of God&rsquo;s Holy
Spirit in any life is the harbouring of sensual appetite or craving,
passion, or indulgence.&nbsp; No man can expect the Holy Spirit of God
to make its home in such unclean company.&nbsp; It is on this account
that there is nothing which so soon grows to depraved habit, to God-abandoned
state, as sensual appetite; nothing which so rapidly dulls the higher
affections in the heart and saps all the finer elements of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we are thinking of God&rsquo;s gift of the Holy Ghost,
and of spiritual power as the saving and uplifting influence in our
soul, we do well to reflect a little on those hindrances which will
be fatal to all such power in us, if they are allowed to take possession
of our life and to prevail in it.</p>
<p><!-- page 185--><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>We do well to
reflect in this way, because such reflection will make us very careful
against harbouring or encouraging any of these fatal hindrances, and
careful also against any other form of spiritual waste.</p>
<p>There is no surer guide to a right use of all liberty than this reflection
upon the power of the indwelling spirit in us, and the things that add
to it or destroy it.</p>
<p>Recognising that this Spirit, which, in the language of your confirmation
prayer, is the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel
and ghostly strength, the Spirit of knowledge and true godliness and
of holy fear; recognising that this Spirit, with its sevenfold gifts,
is the saving element in all free life, you begin to look with fresh
feelings on all your leisure hours, on all your hours of liberty, when
you are released from task work or supervision, when your life is what
you yourselves are making it, and you begin to consider whether these
times, as you spend them, are indeed times of growth or, it may be,
<!-- page 186--><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>of waste, times of
genuine freedom or of slavery to some form of lower life.&nbsp; When
you think of this Holy Spirit of God as a power in every good life,
it becomes a very real question what and of what sort is the <i>power</i>
that is holding sway over you in your leisure hours.</p>
<p>This is indeed a question which never sleeps, and to-day we ask,
What is your Whitsuntide answer to it?</p>
<p>If there be any one to whom such a question is not yet a matter of
living concern, it is the purpose of this Pentecostal festival to rouse
him to new thoughts about it.</p>
<p>If there be any older person in this congregation who lets his years
slip from him, not caring or forgetting the importance of it, and not
striving to leaven all his hours of work or leisure with the thought
of this indwelling Spirit from above; or if there should be any young
boy who, in utter thoughtlessness, or from perversity or coarseness,
or any induced depravity of <!-- page 187--><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>taste,
allows any evil spirit to bear rule in his life, our prayer for such
an one to-day is that the baptism of fire may descend upon his soul,
and the power of a new spirit be felt in it.</p>
<p>And indeed there is not one of us but needs to come at such a time
with this same prayer for his own life; for our own experience is too
often very like the vision of Ezekiel.&nbsp; Under the influences that
come between us and the Spirit of the living God, our soul is in continual
danger of being like the prophet&rsquo;s valley of dry bones, which
lay lifeless, unmoved, till the breath of the Lord breathed over them,
and the breath came into them, and they lived, and stood up upon their
feet, an exceeding great army.</p>
<p>So we pray that our life may prove responsive to these influences
of the Pentecostal season.&nbsp; And the first response it gives is
when it rises up in the consciousness of the Spirit of God as a living
power in the heart, a power to drive out evil, and <!-- page 188--><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>to
inspire and strengthen us for what is good.</p>
<p>And if, under the inspiring associations of this historic and holy
day, you feel your soul touched with a new spirit or consciousness rising
up in you from the grave of its own dead self to new desires and new
thoughts, and a new sense of the living nearness of the Holy Ghost the
Comforter, then you know&mdash;and you need no prophet to tell you&mdash;that
the Pentecostal gift has not failed, and there is good hope that you
will not spoil either your youth or your manhood with any form of ignoble
life.</p>
<h2><!-- page 189--><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>XIX.&nbsp; SANCTIFIED
FOR SERVICE.</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are labourers together with God; ye are God&rsquo;s
husbandry; ye are God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo;&mdash;1 <span class="smcap">Cor</span>.
iii. 9.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this passage St. Paul is rebuking the Corinthians for that spirit
of party which was dividing them into followers of this or that teacher
and so destroying their unity in Christ.&nbsp; You do not belong, he
says, to Paul or to Apollos; <i>we</i> have no claim upon you; ye are
not to be called by <i>our</i> name: you are <i>God&rsquo;s</i> husbandry,
and <i>God&rsquo;s</i> building, not ours; we are but labourers in His
service and ministers for your good.&nbsp; Therefore, see to it that
you live as one society in Christ Jesus, discarding all divisions, factions,
and party passions and watchwords, imbued with one spirit.&nbsp; It
is a noble exhortation to unity of life and purpose; but we may notice
in it more than this.</p>
<p><!-- page 190--><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>As Paul himself
disclaims all personal merit&mdash;as he presses it on their attention
that neither is he that planteth anything nor he that watereth, but
God that giveth the increase, he is unconsciously exhibiting to us an
example of that rare humility which is characteristic of all the greatest
and most effective workers; whilst in the vivid and expressive metaphors
of my text&mdash;ye are God&rsquo;s husbandry, God&rsquo;s building&mdash;he
makes us to feel the value and the dignity of each human soul.</p>
<p>It would be interesting to dwell on these calls to unity of life
in Christ, and the close connection between such unity and the spirit
of humility; in fact, we might say, the absolute necessity of the spirit
of humility and self-forgetfulness in individuals if there is to be
unity in the society.&nbsp; And we might apply the thoughts with much
profit to our own social relations, for they are never out of date;
but I desire to turn to-day to that which is suggested by these descriptive
metaphors, the value and dignity of each human life.</p>
<p><!-- page 191--><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>St. Paul pressed
it on these Corinthians that their souls were nothing less than the
seed-field of which God Himself was the Husbandman, or the temple built
by His hand; and they could hardly have listened to such language without
being stirred to take care how they sowed in that field, or without
feeling the consequent value of their life in the sight of God.</p>
<p>If they were thus the objects of the Divine care they could not be
thought of as insignificant units in a crowded city; or as living an
obscure life which was of no particular importance, as they might otherwise
have been tempted to fancy, as we are still sometimes tempted to think
about an individual life.&nbsp; This picture of each life amongst us
in its relation to God, as His seed-field or His temple, is a continual
reminder that where a human soul is concerned there is no such thing
as insignificance or obscurity.</p>
<p>As St. Paul thought of that little company&mdash;a company small
and obscure to the outward eye&mdash;what he saw in them was the temple
of the <!-- page 192--><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Holy Ghost,
and the spiritual life that was breathing there was a Divine life; and
this intense conviction of the value of each soul and each society and
its consequent sanctity was a never-failing inspiration to him.</p>
<p>Through it he saw in every one who listened to his words, as he went
from city to city, a man created and endowed with a Divine mission and
Divine capacity, if they could only be roused.</p>
<p>It transformed every soul that crossed his path, so that he looked
on life with new eyes.&nbsp; The common crowd had a new interest for
him, the suffering poor, the downtrodden slave, the heathen in his blindness,
the degraded sinner.</p>
<p>And it has been so with all the great servants of God; out of this
feeling the love of souls has grown in men.</p>
<p>But this feeling of the value of each individual life, because of
the Divine element and presence in it, is a peculiar gift of the Christian
revelation.</p>
<p>In the ancient pagan world a man&rsquo;s life <!-- page 193--><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>was
of little account; it is out of the Bible that this new thought has
come that every soul has in it an indefinite element of Divine possibilities,
and is therefore of value in the sight of God.&nbsp; It is by virtue
of this contribution to our thought that the Bible is truly described
as the Great Charter of human rights, and as the source of the great
stream of charity and self-sacrifice, of that enthusiasm of humanity
which more than all else separates and distinguishes our life from that
of heathen antiquity.</p>
<p>It would indeed be difficult to point to any one single thing which
makes so great a difference between the quality of one man&rsquo;s life
and another&rsquo;s as the presence or absence of this feeling about
the value, the possibilities, the sanctity of each individual soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let man estimate himself,&rdquo; said Pascal, &ldquo;let him
estimate himself at his true value, honour himself in his capacities,
and despise himself in his neglect of those capacities.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yes, if a man is once brought to this condition that he feels the greatness
of the ends for <!-- page 194--><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>which
God has made him, and that he estimates his life by the possibilities
of growth that are in it, and by the thought of the Divine influences
that work in it; and if he despises himself for neglect of these capacities
or possibilities and of these influences, he has awoke to a sense of
the first word of Christ and His Apostles.</p>
<p>Your soul is God&rsquo;s seed-field, God&rsquo;s building; we are
labourers together with God.&nbsp; Such a description of each individual
life is very significant everywhere, and not least in such a society
as ours.</p>
<p>To us who are here in this society as masters they are just a parable
of our own life; setting forth to each of us what should be his estimate
of his own work and aim and purpose, exhibiting to him his field of
work with the Divine light on it, and interpreting to him his own endeavours
as a fellow-labourer with God, hoping to contribute in some degree towards
the filling in and completing that Divine plan, that ideal picture of
the life of every one of you which <!-- page 195--><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>is
in the heavens, and which in imagination he sees as a thing some day
to be realised, and the realisation of which, or its failure, may largely
depend on his own share in our life and work.&nbsp; It is this feeling
that every heart contains the germ of some perfection that makes our
life so profoundly interesting, and, it may be added, our responsibilities
for the cultivation or neglect of any such germ or capacity so serious
and engrossing.</p>
<p>But to you, too, these apostolic suggestions about the Divine influences
at work in each heart, and the value of each life in God&rsquo;s sight,
and the Divine voices claiming to be heard in it, should be quite as
stimulative as they are to us.</p>
<p>They have in them the germ of all striving after purity and goodness,
and of all hatred of sin, and enthusiasm for the uplifting of social
life.</p>
<p>The words of Paul to his Corinthian converts may furnish you with
new interpretations of your own daily life and duty.</p>
<p><!-- page 196--><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>If they were God&rsquo;s
husbandry, or God&rsquo;s building, are not you?&nbsp; If the Spirit
of God dwelt in them, how does He not dwell likewise in you? striving
for your growth in holiness and good purpose, and for your salvation
from sin and its defilements, as he strove for theirs?</p>
<p>And if it was good for every man in that Corinthian community to
be warned how he built upon the foundation of life that had been laid
in Christ; if it was good for them to be reminded that every man&rsquo;s
work would be made manifest, and that the fire would try it, of what
sort it was; it is good also for us, masters and boys alike, to remember
that we are living under the same law, and that we should take care
lest haply we be found to be working against God.</p>
<p>That Epistle of St. Paul&rsquo;s was written in pain and anguish
of heart.&nbsp; The seeds of Christian life which he had sown among
them, the purifying influences of the Holy Spirit which were working
among them through him and his fellow-labourers, all these ought <!-- page 197--><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>to
have produced fruits easily described, such as peace and love, and purity,
and good works; but instead of these, and threatening their destruction,
there had sprung up dissension and strife, party spirit, self-conceit,
and gross sins which I need not name.</p>
<p>In all this there was grief, disappointment, bitterness; for did
they not prove that his work was threatened with failure?</p>
<p>Yet in all that storm of feeling his chief exhortation is this reminder
of the dignity of their calling.&nbsp; In the midst of all their sin
and failure, though he does not spare rebuke and warning, he always
aims at inspiring them by uplifting.&nbsp; And we know that this is
the true method, because there is nothing which exercises an influence
so strong to uplift and purify as the feeling of our kinship with the
life above us, and that we are degrading our life when we forget this
or ignore it.&nbsp; And herein is the value of this word of his that
God is dwelling and working in us.&nbsp; &ldquo;Know ye not that ye
are the temple of God, that the Holy Ghost <!-- page 198--><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>dwelleth
in you, and that God&rsquo;s temple is holy? and if any man destroy
the temple of God, him shall God destroy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us then begin again our common life with a determination to bear
in mind the possibilities and the sanctity of each separate soul that
comes amongst us.</p>
<p>Living in crowds, we are apt to forget this; and, forgetting it,
some treat their own souls as if they were of no value, and some the
souls of others, and so the work of sin and waste goes on from generation
to generation.</p>
<p>But in our best moments, in our times of serious thought, if we have
been once enlightened, we can never again cease to feel the dignity
and the value of each human life.</p>
<p>When we think of God&rsquo;s care for us we feel it; when we think
of the possibilities He has ordained for us we feel it; when we think
of the endless life that lies before us we feel it; above all,
we never fail to feel it when our thoughts revert to any life that has
been snatched away from us.&nbsp; Some of <!-- page 199--><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>you
are thinking to-day of the master whose home is darkened by the presence
of the angel of death.&nbsp; You think of her whom God has taken, who
was moving among you not so long ago, as your tender, considerate, and
helpful friend.&nbsp; It may be that you were not uninfluenced by her
self-devotion and holiness.</p>
<p>When you think of such an one you feel no doubt about the value and
the sanctity of each human life.</p>
<p>Well, then, transfer this feeling to your own life, or to the life
of the boy who sits beside you, or who lives as your companion.&nbsp;
In the purpose of our common Father, your lives also are destined for
holy uses.</p>
<p>To remember this may be a safeguard against temptation or sinful
habit; it may inspire you with a new feeling of the value of <i>all</i>
the lives around you, and a new sense of the duty you owe to the good
life of this society in which God has placed you, that you may prove
a vessel of honour sanctified for His service.</p>

Passion and Death is just in front of us, and the shadow of His Cross
is falling over us, one generation after another of the boys of this
school gather here, and in the face of the congregation, young and old,
they take upon them the vows of a Christian life.&nbsp; So we met last
Thursday, and your vow is still fresh upon a great many of you, as indeed
it can hardly fail to be fresh in the memory of every one in this congregation
who has ever taken it.&nbsp; Let us pause for a moment and repeat its
plain words.&nbsp; You have declared your faith in God the Father, God
the Son, <!-- page 201--><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>and God
the Holy Ghost, the Father, the Redeemer, the Sanctifier of your life.&nbsp;
You have vowed that you renounce the devil and his works, that you renounce
covetous desires, that you renounce the carnal desires of the flesh,
so that you will not follow nor be led by them.&nbsp; And you have vowed
that you will keep God&rsquo;s holy will and commandments, and walk
in them all the days of your life.&nbsp; And you take this upon you,
let us hope, in sincerity and honesty of purpose.</p>
<p>And, if so, the text I have read to you declares God&rsquo;s promise,
if you persevere, just as another text in the same chapter declares
that into the City of God there shall not enter anything that defileth
or worketh abomination or maketh a lie.&nbsp; This, then, is the promise&mdash;&ldquo;He
that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and
he shall be My son.&rdquo;&nbsp; But as we think of this and look forward,
we have to remember that this life to which you are dedicated is not
an easy matter.&nbsp; If you are to succeed in it, you have to think
of it always as a life under a vow, as in fact a consecrated <!-- page 202--><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>life,
consecrated by your own promise and profession.&nbsp; And this is a
great safeguard if you bear it always in mind.</p>
<p>It is indeed the first condition of safety from the attacks and the
impulses of sin, this consciousness which you will carry about with
you, that you are self-dedicated&mdash;that there was a day on which
you said &ldquo;I will&rdquo;&mdash;so that if you are to be true to
your profession and declared purpose, you will strive to keep near to
God in the spirit, and you will have no dealings with the devil and
his works, and you will resist all the degrading solicitations of the
flesh, and will live in the atmosphere of things that are pure and of
good report.</p>
<p>To have conceived such a purpose as this, to have opened your heart
to its influence, to have lived in it even for a little while, to have
felt its purifying and strengthening breath upon your soul even for
a few weeks, may be enough, as some of you know very well, to lift your
life up to a new level, so that it becomes and is felt by you to be
a quite different life <!-- page 203--><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>from
what you lived before&mdash;a life of new thoughts, of new notions about
what is good or what is evil, about the degrading character of sin and
the misery and hatefulness of it, as also about the happiness of a life
that is inspired by good aims and purposes, and is free from a sense
of God&rsquo;s wrath upon you for some low standard of conduct, or some
sinful appetite or passion.&nbsp; If you have once felt the influence
of this change in your heart, you know the difference henceforth between
the higher life and the lower, the life that is clinging to God, however
feebly, and is in the way of salvation, and the life of sin which will
inevitably end in degradation and in death.</p>
<p>But this life in Christ to which you are dedicated is not an easy
one; let us not suppose it.&nbsp; It is a noble life, and every one
who strives to live it is doing something to ennoble his society; but
it is not an easy life.&nbsp; It is never so represented to us in the
Bible.&nbsp; There is a sense no doubt in which our Lord invites us
to see how easy is His yoke compared <!-- page 204--><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>with
the yoke of sin&mdash;but He Himself calls upon every believer to take
up his cross and follow Him.&nbsp; That call may bring to any of us
not peace but a sword.&nbsp; St. Paul sets the Christian life before
us as a race to be run with patience; as a conflict which will sometimes
be very hard.&nbsp; In St. James we see it as the discipline of sore
temptation, and in St. Peter it is the fiery trial that is to try us.</p>
<p>And again, in the Revelation of St. John, we have this picture of
blessing only to those that endure, and to those who have not defiled
their garments, and those who have come through great tribulation.</p>
<p>And all our personal experience confirms this language of Holy Scripture,
reminding us, as it does, how hard it is for an individual to keep in
the narrow way of the spotless Christian life, and how it is still harder
to stamp the mark of Christian purpose upon a society.</p>
<p>Yet these are the two things to which God is calling us.&nbsp; These
you have in fact vowed that you will strive after; and if you are <!-- page 205--><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>unfaithful
in either respect, if you give up your effort for an easy, drifting
life, you are letting go your confirmation vows; and whereas you were
intended to be the salt of your society, your salt will lose its savour.&nbsp;
To consider this just now may save some of you from discouragement and
some from waste and failure.</p>
<p>Men are stronger to meet their difficulties if they know that they
have to meet them or else to fail and sink.&nbsp; And so it will be
with you.&nbsp; You will be more likely to go forward strong in earnest
purpose, strong in the strength which God supplies, if you bear it in
mind that, as St. Paul would have expressed it, we are appointed unto
these trials; and that a soldier of Christ must expect to have to endure
hardness; and in fact that it is a law of our spiritual life that one
of the chief roots of all growth in strength and goodness is suffering.&nbsp;
We grow through trial and suffering to true manhood in Christ.</p>
<p>So, if you look at your own life and experience, you will find that
some suffer <!-- page 206--><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>through
a sore struggle with their own temptations, or their own weaknesses&mdash;their
desires, their appetites, their fears, or the habits they have contracted,
and their struggle may be so hard that it needs all the grace of God
to keep them firm in their purpose.&nbsp; Some again suffer not from
internal but from external hindrances.&nbsp; Companions may be against
them, or a low public opinion may be against them, and they may feel
as if they could hardly stand firm in isolation, or under suspicion,
or mockery, or enmity; and some may suffer because the conscience around
them is depraved, and they feel too weak to fight against it, though
they know and acknowledge its depravity.&nbsp; But however hard may
be the fight there should be no discouragement, if only you are able
still to say in all honesty that you are holding fast to the good purpose
which you uttered in your confirmation vows.&nbsp; Two quite simple
warnings may sometimes do us great service&mdash;one, is that we are
very apt to exaggerate <!-- page 207--><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>the
forces against us.&nbsp; They seem very strong when we are feeling weak;
but they sometimes break up and disappear if they are met with a little
courage.&nbsp; And the other warning is this, that we sometimes let
ourselves sink and drift into sinful ways or moral cowardice, by neglecting
the helps which God gives us for the strengthening of a good life in
us.</p>
<p>Thus if we neglect real prayer, or do not seek the support of good
companionship, if we take no pains to live in a good atmosphere and
amidst good surroundings, if there is little of devout thought or habitual
worship in our life and still less of Holy Communion, if we thus allow
ourselves to drift out of the range of the higher moral and spiritual
influences, our vows are forgotten and our good purposes fade away,
our will becomes weak, and the world with all its temptations is very
likely to overcome us.</p>
<p>Feeling the infinite issues that hang on such considerations as these,
let us carry about with <!-- page 208--><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>us
the inspiring and invigorating call and the promise contained in the
text with which I began this sermon&mdash;&ldquo;He that overcometh
shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be My
son.&rdquo;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
